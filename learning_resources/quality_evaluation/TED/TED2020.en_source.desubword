And▁as a▁result, patent▁trolls can▁kind of live in the▁space in▁between.
Now▁this is just▁another▁great▁service▁provided▁by the▁oceans▁since▁carbon▁dioxide is▁one of the▁greenhouse▁gases that's▁causing▁climate▁change.

You can▁imagine▁more▁barriers.
It▁tells▁us that▁these▁cells▁from the▁small▁airways in▁our▁lungs,▁actually▁have▁these▁hairlike▁structures that you▁would▁expect to▁see in the▁lung.
And▁mostly also▁because I▁realized▁out of a Rem Koolhaas▁presentation to the▁city of Porto,▁where he▁talked▁about a▁conglomeration of▁various▁layers of▁meaning.
So▁if you look▁at the little▁script▁here, the▁speed is▁always▁going to be 30.
▁As I▁tried to▁process▁what he was▁saying, I was▁thinking, "What the hell is▁wrong▁with you?"
So we▁said, "If▁people▁are not▁sensitive to the▁economic rational▁theory▁explanations, to▁these▁forces,▁what▁could be▁going on?"
It is the▁ties▁between▁people that▁makes the▁whole▁greater▁than the sum of▁its▁parts.
I▁had▁this▁company that I'd▁spent 15▁years▁building. It's▁called Future;▁it was a▁magazine▁publishing▁company.

▁Voters▁should be▁able to▁check that▁their▁votes▁are▁counted▁correctly,▁without▁breaking▁election▁secrecy,▁which is so▁very▁important.
I▁tried to look▁at▁what▁factors▁actually▁accounted the▁most for▁success and▁failure▁across all of▁these▁companies, and the▁results▁really▁surprised me.
And I▁say, "OK."
So I've▁been▁trying to▁learn to do▁things that▁are▁hands-on.
FGM is▁child▁abuse.
▁Well,▁some▁are, and a▁few▁are▁really▁at the▁vanguard.
I've▁always▁written▁primarily▁about▁architecture,▁about▁buildings, and▁writing▁about▁architecture is▁based on▁certain▁assumptions.

▁Finally, the▁newest and▁fastest▁types of▁long-term▁storage▁are▁solid-state▁drives, like▁flash▁sticks.
But▁it's all▁coming in▁through▁one▁incision.
So▁it's like▁marrying▁up all the▁things that we▁have and▁it's an▁adaptation of▁our▁way of▁life,▁full▁stop.
And also the▁fans of Star Trek▁watch▁with▁amusement▁this▁seemingly▁contradictory▁behavior.
And▁it▁makes▁sense that we▁put a▁lot of▁effort▁into▁making▁babies▁think like▁adults do.

He's▁named▁after the Star Trek▁character.
And so▁there's▁companies like▁face.com that▁now▁have▁about 18▁billion▁faces online.
And▁maybe▁there was▁some▁truth to that,▁because I▁thought that▁if I▁started▁walking,▁everyone▁would▁follow.
So,▁as a computer▁scientist▁inspired▁by▁this▁utility of▁our▁interactions▁with▁physical▁objects --▁along▁with my▁adviser Pattie, and my▁collaborator▁Jeevan▁Kalanithi -- I▁started to▁wonder --▁what▁if▁when we▁used a computer,▁instead of▁having▁this▁one▁mouse▁cursor that was a like a digital▁fingertip▁moving▁around a▁flat▁desktop,▁what▁if we▁could▁reach in▁with▁both▁hands and▁grasp▁information▁physically,▁arranging▁it the▁way we▁wanted?
So▁what's▁needed is▁those▁organizations on the▁ground▁advocating for the▁democratic▁culture▁itself to▁create the▁demand on the▁ground for▁this▁culture.

Or▁if he was▁running▁around▁with a▁visibly▁broken leg▁laughing, and▁his▁friends▁are▁going, "Heinrich, I▁think we▁need to▁go to the▁hospital▁now," that also▁wouldn't be▁funny.
▁Local▁Balinese▁women▁cook the▁food on▁sawdust▁burners▁using▁secrets that only▁their▁grandmothers▁know.
▁That's, to▁put▁it▁mildly, not▁what's on the▁table▁now.
So▁what do we▁have to do?
▁Some of my▁reporters▁were▁arrested.
One of▁them▁actually,▁fittingly▁enough,▁found me▁when I▁checked▁into a▁deli▁at a▁restaurant in New York on▁foursquare.
I was just▁looking▁at▁it. And I'm▁telling you -- (Laughter) It's a▁beautiful▁thing. I▁swear to God.
But▁what▁interests my▁company the▁most is the▁fact that you can▁create▁individual▁unique▁products▁en▁masse.
You▁could▁see▁arguments on▁both▁sides.
Now,▁what is a▁phage?
And▁this▁starts▁conversation▁because the▁visual is▁created in▁such a▁way▁where you can▁defend▁two▁answers.
WK: I▁wanted to▁make a▁windmill.
▁Only▁if the▁court was▁able to▁see▁how▁these▁policies▁came▁together▁would he be▁able to▁see the▁double▁discrimination that Emma DeGraffenreid was▁facing.
I▁worried that [if] I▁took my hat▁off I▁wouldn't be▁here▁anymore.
Do you▁think he'd like▁his▁picture of▁his▁shield▁bug? I▁hope so.
So▁how do we▁speed▁up that▁giant▁boulder so we can fix▁climate▁change in▁time?
▁This is▁really▁critical.
So yeah,▁it was▁difficult to▁explain,▁but▁there was a▁grassroots▁movement.
▁She▁got▁it▁because▁she▁spent▁time▁with▁these▁people.
(Applause) So he▁didn't just▁learn▁water.
It's▁always a▁struggle,▁but▁somehow I▁manage to▁sort of get▁this▁thought▁out▁into an▁object, and▁then▁it's▁there, OK.
The▁trophy▁fish▁were so▁big that you▁couldn't▁put▁any of▁those▁small▁fish▁up on▁it.
Now, in▁this▁age,▁again,▁countries▁with▁access to multiple▁channels of▁communication and▁information▁have a▁particular▁advantage.
Who▁here▁has▁ever▁felt▁inadequate▁or▁ashamed▁because you▁weren't▁girly▁enough, you▁were▁too▁girly, you▁weren't▁manly▁enough,▁or▁too▁manly?
And the▁last▁thing is that▁this▁algorithm also▁identifies▁what▁are▁our▁intuitions, of▁which▁words▁should▁lead in the▁neighborhood of▁introspection.
So I▁would like to▁invite you▁from▁whatever▁industry you're▁from to▁join▁us in▁reinventing and▁reimagining the▁world,▁how▁things▁come▁together▁from the▁nanoscale to the▁human▁scale, so that we can▁go▁from a▁world like▁this to a▁world that's▁more like▁this.
For▁some▁patients,▁this▁hundred▁days▁means the▁matter of▁life and▁death.
Do we▁want▁our▁car to▁perhaps be a▁partner, a▁coach,▁someone that can use▁their▁understanding of the▁situation to▁help▁us▁reach▁our▁potential?
In▁fact, Chinese▁food is the▁most▁pervasive▁food on the▁planet,▁served on all▁seven▁continents,▁even▁Antarctica,▁because▁Monday▁night is Chinese▁food▁night▁at McMurdo Station,▁which is the▁main▁scientific▁station in▁Antarctica.
The▁slinky▁moves. We're▁going▁through▁different▁nodes of the▁wave,▁coming▁out▁this▁way.
Tapirs▁cross the▁highways▁after▁dark, so the▁stickers will▁hopefully▁help▁drivers▁see▁this▁shining▁thing▁crossing the▁highway, and▁maybe▁they will▁slow▁down a little▁bit.
And I▁think▁if IBM's Deep Blue▁played▁anyone in▁this▁room,▁it▁would win▁every▁time.
The▁coaches▁want▁players to▁take▁good▁shots.
But the▁miracle that▁happened -- I'm▁going to▁call▁it▁Hotmail for▁short.
(Laughter) Not a▁good▁picture. Now, my▁friends in the▁island of▁Nevis▁are a little▁better. Look▁at that!▁That's Isaac Newton.
▁Thank you so▁much. (TBP: You bet, Chris.▁Thank you.) (Applause)
▁Those▁are the▁two▁choices we▁have. I▁know▁which▁future I▁would▁rather be▁living in.
▁Well, he▁had all▁these▁wonderful little▁golden▁apples, and▁she'd▁run▁ahead, and he'd▁roll a little▁golden▁apple.
So I▁started▁cold-calling, and▁eventually▁got▁through to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, and▁she▁invited me▁down.
▁Being a▁carrier for▁sickle▁cell▁anemia is▁therefore the best▁possible▁genetic▁option in a malarial▁environment.
(Laughter) 'Cause▁they'd▁rather▁believe I▁don't▁exist.
And▁this is not a▁drill --▁it's a▁point of▁inflection.
So the▁question is,▁what is the▁next▁big▁idea for▁this▁generation?
And▁companies like▁Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe, that▁are▁giving you your▁genetic▁profiles,▁are▁giving▁some▁people a▁sense of, "Gosh,▁well,▁what can I do▁about▁it?"
Zero is Zero, a little▁hero of the 21st Century, and Zero can▁touch so▁many▁more▁people▁than I▁possibly▁could.
I'm just▁going to▁play a▁brief▁video▁clip.

But▁when▁hundreds of▁thousands of Chinese▁started▁showing▁up in my▁country,▁working▁hard on the▁railroads and the▁mines and▁then▁kicking▁back in the▁evening just like▁they▁had in the▁old▁country▁with a▁few▁puffs on that opium▁pipe, that's▁when you▁saw the▁first▁drug▁prohibition▁laws in California and Nevada,▁driven▁by▁racist▁fears of Chinese▁transforming▁white▁women▁into opium-addicted▁sex▁slaves.
▁If you look▁out on the▁eight million▁species that we▁share▁this▁planet▁with,▁think of▁them all▁being▁four▁billion▁years of▁evolution.
David Deutsch,▁who's▁talking▁here, in "The▁Fabric of Reality,"▁embraces the▁many-worlds▁interpretation of▁quantum▁theory,▁because the▁worst that you can▁say▁about▁it is that▁it's▁preposterously▁wasteful.
(Laughter) (Applause) "And in▁conclusion, win▁some, lose▁some."

School▁has to be▁bigger.
We▁don't▁need to pass▁these▁expenses on to▁our▁students.
And▁soon▁enough,▁they▁start to▁learn▁about the▁meaning of▁things,▁because▁when▁somebody is▁looking▁at▁something▁or▁somebody is▁pointing▁at▁something,▁they're not just▁getting a▁directional▁cue.
Take a look▁at▁what▁brain▁activity▁might look like.
(Laughter) In your▁own▁mind,▁what do you▁believe the▁chances▁are that▁walking▁around on▁some▁other▁planet is non-carbon-based▁life,▁walking▁or▁oozing▁or▁something?

It's▁difficult for▁them to▁understand that▁they're▁going to die.
I▁wrote▁about my▁good▁days and my▁bad▁days and my▁really▁ugly▁days, and I▁shared▁them on a▁blog.
The▁bus▁rapid▁transport▁system in Bogotá in▁Colombia is a▁very▁important▁case of▁how to▁move▁around▁safely and▁quickly in a non-polluting▁way in a▁city:▁very▁frequent▁buses,▁strongly▁protected▁routes, the▁same▁service,▁really,▁as an▁underground▁railway▁system,▁but▁much,▁much▁cheaper and can be▁done▁much▁more▁quickly, a brilliant▁idea in▁many▁more▁cities▁around the▁world that's▁developing.
We▁need▁really to▁see▁it.
And▁over the▁next▁six▁months, a▁beautiful▁thing▁happened; the▁entrepreneurs▁received the▁money,▁they▁were▁paid, and▁their▁businesses, in▁fact,▁grew, and▁they▁were▁able to▁support▁themselves and▁change the▁trajectory of▁their▁lives.
The▁lesson I▁want to▁leave you▁with,▁from▁these▁data, is that▁our▁longings and▁our▁worries▁are▁both to▁some▁degree▁overblown,▁because we▁have▁within▁us the▁capacity to▁manufacture the▁very▁commodity we▁are▁constantly chasing▁when we▁choose▁experience.
I▁think▁it's just that we▁have to▁think▁very▁deeply▁about the▁implications,▁ramifications of▁our▁actions, and so▁as▁long▁as we▁have▁good,▁deep▁discussion like we're▁having▁now, I▁think we can▁come to a▁very▁good▁solution▁as to▁why to do▁it.
BP: No▁need to be. There's▁nothing▁wrong▁with▁old▁age.
I▁personally▁started▁using the▁men's▁room▁when I▁started▁getting▁confused and▁frightened▁looks in the▁women's▁room,▁even▁though I was▁petrified to▁start▁going▁into the▁men's▁room.
Studied a▁few▁genetic▁markers, and▁there▁are▁lots of▁gaps on▁this▁map.
▁Instead of▁one-size-fits-all▁methods to be▁able to▁treat▁cancers,▁there is a▁whole▁new▁class of▁drugs that▁are▁able to▁target▁cancers▁based on▁their▁unique▁genetic▁profile.
And▁even▁if you▁have▁optimistic▁assumptions▁around▁production▁growth,▁it will▁make that▁slight▁flip.
(Laughter) (Applause) I just▁came to my▁senses,▁obviously.
▁Of▁course, Sisyphus▁refused to▁keep▁his▁promise,▁now▁having▁twice▁escaped▁death▁by▁tricking the▁gods.
In▁this▁picture, you'll▁notice, the bang is▁extended. It's not a▁point.
I▁would love to▁talk▁about my▁astronomy,▁but I▁suspect that the▁number of▁people▁who▁are▁interested in radiative▁transfer in non-gray▁atmospheres and▁polarization of light in Jupiter's▁upper▁atmosphere▁are the▁number of▁people▁who'd fit in a▁bus▁shelter.
▁This▁testimony was▁deeply▁critical of my▁colleagues, of my▁ministers,▁who▁had, in my▁view▁had▁perpetrated a war on a▁falsehood.
Now▁most▁media▁companies --▁television,▁radio,▁publishing,▁games, you▁name▁it --▁they use▁very▁rigid▁segmentation▁methods in▁order to▁understand▁their▁audiences.

The▁photo was▁horrible.
▁This is▁strips of▁Velcro,▁this is my▁drawing▁slate, and▁this is my▁drawing▁pen,▁which is▁basically a▁film▁box.
And▁if we can get▁some▁agreement on▁where we▁want the▁world to be --▁desirable,▁sustainable▁when your▁kids▁reach your▁age -- I▁think we▁actually can▁reach▁it. Now, I▁said▁this was a▁warning, not a▁forecast.▁That was▁before -- I▁painted▁this▁before we▁started in on▁making▁robotic▁versions of▁hawk▁moths and▁cockroaches, and▁now I'm▁beginning to▁wonder▁seriously -- was▁this▁more of a▁forecast▁than I▁wanted?
And▁then▁after you've▁seen all of▁this, and▁prepared▁yourself▁mentally and▁physically,▁then you▁are▁ready to▁see▁something▁with a▁long▁duration, like in▁immaterial▁art.
He▁had▁mastered▁calculus on▁his▁own▁by the▁age of 15 and▁done▁well▁at▁both▁his▁Munich▁secondary▁school and▁at the▁Swiss Polytechnic,▁where he▁studied for a▁math and▁physics▁teaching▁diploma.
▁Several▁groups▁are▁studying▁conditions like▁depression,▁schizophrenia and bipolar and▁what's▁going on in▁terms of▁sleep▁disruption.
So,▁there's▁more and▁more▁activity▁near the▁boat, and all of a▁sudden▁somebody▁shouts, "What's that in the▁water?"
We▁are in a▁room▁with▁one of the▁senior▁members of the community and a▁health▁care▁worker.
And the▁distribution of▁Japanese is▁totally▁different,▁where we▁see a▁group of▁intermediate▁sounds,▁which is▁known▁as the▁Japanese "R."

To▁give the▁aid, and▁hope and▁pray that▁something▁comes▁out of▁it?
But the real▁powers of▁this▁place▁come▁from▁phytoplankton.
I've▁been▁put on private▁jets and▁flown▁around the▁world.
▁If you've▁got that, you're▁with me for the▁entire▁journey. Okay?
And▁because▁many of▁our▁governments▁are▁quite▁dictatorial,▁they▁need▁really to▁have the▁army▁clobber the▁opposition.
(SJ▁gasps) Have a look.
And we've▁made▁some▁advances so▁far,▁but▁there's still a▁long▁way to▁go, and▁hopefully▁some of you can▁contribute to that▁destination.
Oh,▁what a▁joy▁it▁has▁been to be a▁person▁seeking to▁tangibilitate▁compassion.
(Laughter) But I▁came to a▁realization▁about my▁own▁ability.
The▁problem is that▁there's just▁too▁much▁nitrogen and▁phosphorus▁right▁now,▁too▁much▁phytoplankton▁falling to the▁bottom and▁decomposed▁by▁bacteria that use▁up the▁oxygen.
▁Ten▁percent of the▁time▁people's▁minds▁are▁wandering▁when▁they're▁having▁sex. (Laughter) But▁there's▁something I▁think that's▁quite▁interesting in▁this▁graph, and that is,▁basically▁with▁one▁exception, no▁matter▁what▁people▁are▁doing,▁they're▁mind-wandering▁at least 30▁percent of the▁time,▁which▁suggests, I▁think, that▁mind-wandering▁isn't just▁frequent,▁it's▁ubiquitous.
So we▁should get▁started▁now.
But the▁wealth▁gaps▁are▁growing wider.

We▁are not▁going to▁see the▁image of the▁star and the▁planet▁as▁this.
The▁answers to▁these▁big▁questions▁show that we▁have▁made▁remarkable▁progress in the▁last▁hundred▁years.
▁Some of the▁heat▁radiates▁down▁into the▁deep▁ocean and▁gets▁stored in▁different▁layers, the▁ocean▁acting▁as▁some▁kind of▁planetary-scale▁boiler to▁store all that▁energy,▁which▁later▁might be▁released in▁short-term▁events like▁hurricanes▁or▁long-term▁phenomena like El Niño.
So my▁bike was▁stolen▁while I was▁riding▁it -- (Laughter)▁which is▁possible▁if you're▁riding▁slowly▁enough,▁which I was.
Now in Ireland,▁scientists▁are also▁monitoring▁ocean▁acidification --▁scientists▁at the Marine Institute and NUI▁Galway.
▁That's▁when I▁got▁scared.
▁This▁process is a▁very▁calculated▁process.
▁Until you▁read,▁as I▁did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.
So▁without that▁curiosity-driven▁understanding of the▁structure of▁atoms,▁which▁led to▁this▁rather▁esoteric▁theory,▁quantum▁mechanics,▁then we▁wouldn't▁have▁transistors, we▁wouldn't▁have▁silicon▁chips, we▁wouldn't▁have▁pretty▁much the▁basis of▁our modern▁economy.
On▁February 17th▁they▁passed▁it▁again▁with▁another▁vote of 114 to▁one.
It's all▁about you and me.
And▁atmospheres do the▁same.
So▁it▁radically▁improved my▁decision-making.

You can▁answer that▁one▁pretty▁readily,▁at least for▁most▁people.
There's a▁belief▁among▁our▁people that▁morning▁brings▁good▁news.
The▁final▁thing that I▁want to▁tell you▁about is a▁prize we▁gave to Dr.▁Elena▁Bodnar.
▁This is not▁unusual, and▁it's▁part of▁what▁enables▁people to▁maintain▁these▁kinds of▁changes,▁because▁it▁makes a▁big▁difference in▁their▁quality of▁life.
We can also use▁cymatics▁as a▁beautiful▁natural▁art▁form.
▁How do we▁take an▁understanding of the▁money▁mistakes▁people▁make, and▁then▁turning the▁behavioral▁challenges▁into▁behavioral▁solutions?
And▁this is▁exactly▁why▁failed▁states▁are so▁dangerous.
Now▁this is a▁very▁interesting▁thing.
▁This is▁actually a▁biomaterial.
▁They all▁gather▁together.
▁Twenty▁percent of▁kids do not▁have▁those▁relationships.
He was▁tortured,▁brutally▁tortured to▁death.
It's a▁perfect▁story for a▁nerd like me.
I▁refer to▁organized▁crime.
We▁did▁research. We▁counseled the▁partners of▁infected▁men▁about▁how to▁protect▁themselves.
It was in the▁football▁ground.
These▁are▁four▁very▁different▁ways of▁looking▁at the▁world.
I▁actually▁used to▁joke▁at the▁time and▁say▁if you▁really▁screwed▁up▁as a▁caller, you▁might▁end▁up▁running the▁place.
▁When the▁scientific▁method▁provided that▁new▁way of▁thinking and▁biology▁showed that▁microorganisms▁caused▁disease,▁suffering was▁alleviated.

So▁if you▁see▁one of▁these▁maps of the Internet,▁it's just▁somebody's▁guess.
▁That is,▁it is▁possible for▁these▁three▁drivers of▁our▁world to▁increase▁happiness, to▁increase positive▁emotion.
In▁this▁way -- (Laughter) In▁this▁way, I▁actually▁started to▁learn▁about▁nature.
I'm not an▁evil man.
One▁thing that▁people, I▁think,▁often miss is that▁these▁kinds of▁leaps▁generate▁compounding▁gains.
So in▁short, the▁question we▁have▁tonight is,▁how do we▁understand▁this▁mega-change,▁which I▁believe to be the▁biggest▁change for the▁first half of the 21st▁century?
I▁work▁direct▁with the▁right▁brain.
▁When we look▁at the▁demographic▁shifts of▁people▁coming▁from the▁west,▁it▁appears that▁what we're▁seeing▁now is the▁wrath of▁grapes.
But I will▁demonstrate▁different▁ways to get▁rid of▁difficulties and▁go to the▁point, to find an▁answer▁probably▁much▁quicker▁than Arthur▁did. So,▁first, we▁violate the▁common▁sense, the▁logic. All of you,▁if you hold your hand like▁this, 90▁degrees -- all of you. Not you.
(Laughter)▁What is the▁objective?
And I▁think that's▁what's▁going to▁happen.
I▁want to▁know▁now. Can you▁help▁us?"
▁Fundamentally,▁these▁technologies▁exist▁today.
The▁second▁piece of▁bad▁news will be▁delivered to you▁by▁neuroscientists,▁who will▁tell you that▁if you▁are▁older▁than▁four▁or▁five▁years of▁age, that▁even▁if you▁have your▁eye▁corrected, the▁chances of your▁brain▁learning▁how to▁see▁are▁very,▁very▁slim --▁again,▁slim▁or▁none.

▁That is,▁they can▁disconnect▁fractally and▁then▁reconnect▁seamlessly.
▁This is Oliver▁Medvedik.
▁Except that he's▁carrying a▁tube for▁blueprints and▁stuff --▁they all do -- and a▁lot of▁people▁thought that▁meant▁it was a▁terrorist▁about to▁shoot▁rockets▁at the Tour de France --▁sign of▁our▁times, I▁guess.
My▁desperation▁made me an▁innovator.
B is a▁fake.▁Well▁done▁second▁group. You▁dominated the▁first▁group. (Laughter) You're▁actually a little▁bit▁unusual.▁Every▁time we▁demonstrate▁this,▁it's▁usually▁about a 50-50▁split,▁which▁fits▁with the▁research, 54▁percent.▁Maybe▁people▁here in Winnipeg▁are▁more▁suspicious and▁better▁at▁figuring▁it▁out.
(Applause) But the▁point is,▁if you▁start▁with▁this▁first▁principle of▁benefiting▁everyone,▁then elegant▁solutions▁may▁become▁more▁obvious▁than you▁assume.
There was▁something you▁could▁have▁said to your▁kid,▁when he▁or▁she▁said, "I▁have a▁dream."
In▁addition,▁it is not▁applicable to all▁patients.

We▁went▁down to the▁airfield▁early▁because▁this is the Army and you▁always▁go▁early.
▁They▁are▁more▁expensive in▁places like North America.
▁Once the▁spot▁disappeared and I▁could▁see▁his▁wound,▁which was▁very▁serious, my▁buddies and I▁put a▁sheet▁underneath▁him, and we▁carried▁him▁onto an▁elevator that▁stopped▁at▁each of the 15▁floors.
The▁big▁idea▁here is, I▁think, a▁new▁piece of a▁solution to a▁fairly▁big▁problem in▁transportation.
▁Before,▁revolutions▁used to▁have▁ideological▁names.

My▁friend Brad▁Kessler▁says that we▁didn't▁become▁human▁until we▁started▁keeping▁goats.
And we▁got,▁again,▁about▁three to▁six▁times▁more▁stem▁cells▁than the▁standard▁approach▁done on the▁same▁patient.
But▁this is just▁one,▁two,▁three▁billion▁people, and▁obviously,▁there▁are▁seven▁billion▁people in the▁world, so▁there▁must be▁one,▁two,▁three,▁four▁billion▁people▁more▁who live in▁between the▁poverty and the▁air▁line.
"What is▁this?"
So,▁here is --▁here is a▁couple▁pieces.▁Move▁them▁together, and▁now▁this is an▁active▁piece.

It▁specifies▁certain▁benefits that the▁state can▁uniquely▁bestow on the▁operators.
▁They're▁redefining▁what we all▁consider▁possible.
It is▁one▁one-hundredth of▁one▁percent of▁genetic▁material that▁makes the▁difference▁between▁any▁one of▁us.

And so▁glaciers▁are▁these▁magnificent▁beings, and▁there's▁lots of▁reasons to be▁obsessed▁with▁them,▁but▁what I'm▁particularly▁interested in is in▁human-glacier▁relations.
So▁if▁it is▁those▁networks and▁their▁mathematical▁structure,▁unlike▁biology,▁which▁had sublinear▁scaling,▁economies of▁scale, you▁had the▁slowing of the▁pace of▁life▁as you get▁bigger.
▁Let's just▁take▁one of▁those▁companies.
▁Inside the▁Rolls-Royce is the Queen▁Mother.
▁They▁took▁out▁two of my▁broken▁ribs and▁they▁rebuilt my▁back -- L1,▁they▁rebuilt▁it,▁they▁took▁out▁another▁broken▁rib,▁they▁fused T12, L1 and L2▁together.

▁Why▁has▁it▁accelerated▁lately?
But▁let me▁tell you a little▁bit▁about Feynman the▁physicist.
There▁are▁people▁who▁are▁gruff and▁tough on the▁surface▁but▁underneath▁have▁others' best▁interests▁at▁heart.
I▁mean, we're▁beginning to▁see▁some of the▁big▁problems▁around▁something like▁business▁are▁recycling and▁energy▁conservation.
▁Commerce, on the▁other hand, is▁relatively▁quick,▁essentially▁creative,▁highly▁effective and▁efficient, and▁fundamentally▁honest,▁because we can't▁exchange value for▁very▁long▁if we▁don't▁trust▁each▁other.
And▁it▁creates a▁kind of▁stickiness▁between the community and the▁company▁which is▁really,▁really▁powerful.

I▁don't▁have a▁pointer▁here,▁but you▁see the▁green,▁sort of▁rectangle▁or▁trapezoid?
▁Instead of▁going▁mountain▁climbing▁when you're 82,▁why▁don't you do▁it▁next▁week?
▁Together▁with▁quantum▁mechanics, the▁geometry of▁this▁shape▁could▁describe▁everything▁about▁how the▁universe▁works▁at the▁tiniest▁scales.
The▁very▁first▁week▁into the▁project, we▁actually▁chose a▁pretty▁cold and▁impersonal▁topic.
It▁went▁from▁interest to▁obsession▁when I▁realized▁through my▁research▁how▁broken the▁system was and▁how▁very little▁data was▁being▁used to▁make▁such▁critical▁decisions.
I’m▁going▁around the▁world▁giving▁talks▁about Darwin, and▁usually▁what I’m▁talking▁about is Darwin’s▁strange▁inversion of▁reasoning.
Now I▁give you,▁from▁our▁research, a▁very▁short▁claim.

So▁since we can▁make▁some▁interesting▁protocells that we like,▁interesting▁colors and▁interesting▁behaviors, and▁they're▁very▁easy to▁make, and▁they▁have▁interesting▁lifelike▁properties,▁perhaps▁these▁protocells▁have▁something to▁tell▁us▁about the▁origin of▁life on the Earth.▁Perhaps▁these▁represent an▁easily▁accessible▁step,▁one of the▁first▁steps▁by▁which▁life▁got▁started on the▁early Earth.
▁Did you▁notice▁other▁people not▁finding the▁app that▁day?
▁This▁happens▁one▁day: I'd just▁assigned my▁class to▁read▁this▁textbook▁chapter▁about my▁favorite▁subject in all of▁biology:▁viruses and▁how▁they▁attack.
Sooner▁or▁later,▁it will▁out.
And▁although▁each▁cell▁has▁roughly 2,000▁genes -- that's▁one▁tenth the▁size of the▁human▁genome --▁as you▁sequence▁more and▁more, you find that▁they only▁have a▁thousand of▁those in▁common and the▁other▁thousand for▁each▁individual▁strain is▁drawn▁from an▁enormous▁gene▁pool, and▁it▁reflects the▁particular▁environment that the▁cell▁might▁have▁thrived in, not just high▁or▁low light▁or high▁or▁low▁temperature,▁but▁whether▁there▁are▁nutrients that▁limit▁them like▁nitrogen,▁phosphorus▁or▁iron.
Now, I▁have▁this▁device on.
So the▁implication of▁this is that you▁should▁go for a▁walk▁before your▁next▁big▁meeting and just▁start▁brainstorming▁right▁away.

(Laughter) In▁this▁case,▁supposedly,▁these▁messages▁are▁hidden in▁electronic▁phenomena.
We▁then▁talked▁about her▁coming to my▁lab and▁us▁performing a▁radio▁sweep of her▁car,▁but I▁wasn't▁even▁sure that▁would▁work,▁given that▁some of▁these▁devices▁are▁configured to only▁transmit▁when▁they're▁inside▁safe▁zones▁or▁when the▁car is▁moving.

And we're▁down to▁less▁than 70▁nesting▁pairs in Florida Bay▁today,▁because we've▁disrupted the▁system so▁much.
And▁then▁if I▁go▁over▁here, the▁list▁begins to▁scroll, and▁there▁are▁actually▁thousands of▁feelings that▁have▁been▁collected.
(Laughter)▁Then the▁last▁game I▁did was▁based on▁trying to get the▁video▁game▁industry and Hollywood to▁actually▁work▁together on▁something --▁instead of▁licensing▁from▁each▁other, to▁actually▁work.
OK,▁how▁about▁this▁guy?
▁She▁told me▁about a▁recent▁meeting▁with a▁gruff and▁sometimes▁difficult▁client▁who▁had▁called a▁meeting▁questioning▁progress on▁search▁engine▁optimization.
I▁liked the Media Center PC.
But, in▁fact,▁most▁boys▁tend to be a▁certain▁way, and▁most▁girls▁tend to be a▁certain▁way.
▁This▁young man is▁picking▁organic▁vegetables.
So▁from a▁toxicology▁perspective,▁this is▁really▁awful▁because Corexit and the▁dispersed▁oil▁are▁much▁more▁toxic▁together▁than▁either▁alone.
And▁she▁came▁back, I▁guess▁wealthier▁or▁something --▁something▁happened -- and▁asked me to▁design a▁house for her on▁this▁site.
And▁it was▁this▁thought: to▁create an▁organizational▁structure that▁would▁allow for multiple▁narratives to be▁scripted -- for▁those in the▁educational▁parts that▁create and▁think▁culture; for▁those that▁present the▁visual▁arts, the▁dance; and for the▁public to be▁admitted▁into all of▁this▁with a▁series of▁possible▁trajectories, to▁script▁their▁own▁reading of▁these▁narratives and▁their▁own▁experience.
It's just▁how▁our▁eyes▁work.
We're▁already an▁urban▁planet; that's▁especially▁true in the▁developed▁world.
In the▁last 20▁years, the▁Hearing Voices Movement▁has▁established▁hearing▁voices▁networks in 26▁countries▁across▁five▁continents,▁working▁together to▁promote▁dignity,▁solidarity and▁empowerment for▁individuals in mental▁distress, to▁create a▁new▁language and▁practice of▁hope,▁which,▁at▁its▁very▁center, lies an▁unshakable▁belief in the▁power of the▁individual.
We can't▁make a▁bridge▁with▁squares▁because the▁train▁would▁come,▁it▁would▁start▁doing a▁jig.
▁What I'm▁worried is that we▁throw▁out the▁baby▁with the▁bathwater.
In▁fact,▁if you▁flash▁them▁with a▁camera▁they▁catch on▁fire.
It▁even▁has▁its▁own▁name,▁with Weibo.
▁They▁built▁this▁intricate▁series of▁canals, and▁they▁pushed▁water▁off the land and▁out▁into the▁river.
▁This▁one▁because▁it's so▁large and▁yet▁it's▁pretty▁hard to▁see.
And so▁what I'm▁trying to▁ask,▁what I've▁been▁asking▁myself, is▁what's▁this▁new▁way that the▁world is?
And▁now,▁out of▁typically 46▁cities, 33 of▁those▁mega-cities▁are in the▁developing▁world.
Ignorance is▁bliss,▁they▁say,▁but you can't▁put▁up▁with▁things like▁this."
I▁have to▁think in a▁totally▁new▁way to do▁it,▁but I love▁it.
We also▁have the▁sweat▁bees, and▁these▁are little▁gems▁flying▁around.
And▁finally,▁many▁people▁wrote and▁said, "Let▁us▁patients▁decide▁what's▁important▁when we're▁choosing a▁doctor."
Now we've▁got▁momentum.▁This is the▁tipping▁point.
▁What I▁learned▁from North Idaho is the▁peculiar▁brand of▁paranoia that can▁permeate a community▁when so▁many▁cops and▁guns▁are▁around.
We find▁this in▁every▁country we look▁at.
Now▁what▁happened was, in▁February 2008, Leah and her▁husband▁were▁waiting for a▁cab to▁take▁them▁out for▁dinner,▁when Kobe▁came▁trotting▁up to▁them and he was▁salivating▁with▁saliva.
So▁imagine a▁Syrian▁woman.
(Laughter) I▁mean, the▁story I▁tell is that I▁got▁mad▁at▁postmodernism --▁at po-mo -- and▁said that▁fish▁were 500 million▁years▁earlier▁than man, and▁if you're▁going to▁go▁back, we▁might▁as▁well▁go▁back to the▁beginning.
▁What do▁they▁tell▁us?
▁Even in the▁driest,▁highest▁places on Earth, the▁air is▁sweet and▁thick▁with▁oxygen▁exhaled▁from▁thousands of▁miles▁away▁by▁our▁rainforests.
▁What▁are you▁going to get▁out of▁those▁samples?
I▁walk to▁work▁every▁day▁or▁ride my▁scooter, and I▁come▁down and▁park in▁this little▁spot.
RM:▁Underneath the▁phoenix,▁there's a▁motto on a▁ribbon that▁translates to "Gold in▁peace,▁iron in war," plus -- and▁this is the▁big▁problem --▁it▁says San Francisco▁across the▁bottom.
And on the▁third▁attempt, an▁amazing▁thing▁happened.
So, I was▁interested in▁these▁two▁rollers, and I▁actually▁wanted▁more, so I▁borrowed▁another▁mouse▁from a▁friend --▁never▁returned to▁him -- and I▁now▁had▁four▁rollers.
The▁goal is to▁take▁off,▁end of▁this▁year for the▁first▁test,▁but▁mainly▁next▁year,▁spring▁or▁summer,▁take▁off, on▁our▁own▁power,▁without▁additional▁help,▁without▁being▁towed,▁climb to 9,000▁meters▁altitude.
A▁number that▁hasn't▁changed▁much in the▁past 20▁years.
I▁now▁cover▁Syria, and I▁started▁reporting▁it▁because I▁believed that▁it▁needs to be▁done.
I▁think you▁might get a▁random▁jumble of▁letters that▁looks like▁this.
An▁object▁partially▁immersed in a▁fluid is▁buoyed▁up▁by a▁force▁equal to the▁weight of the▁fluid▁displaced▁by the▁object.
It was▁hailed▁as a▁scientific▁miracle in the▁late 1950s.
To▁create "Lotus," we▁carved▁over 6,000▁figures.
▁This▁year, we're on▁track to▁beat▁it 68▁times▁over.
So the▁servers▁are▁managed▁by a▁ragtag▁band of▁volunteers.
So the▁first▁idea I▁had,▁initially, was just to▁go the▁federal and▁state▁governments and▁go, "Here,▁take▁it, for▁free."
A▁school▁dropout▁from Coimbatore,▁how he is▁able to▁sustaining?
(Music) [music▁by▁Moby] [Grand Canyon]▁Narrator:▁Many of the▁tests▁are▁conducted▁while Yves is strapped▁onto the▁wing,▁because Yves'▁body is an▁integral▁part of the▁aircraft.
So▁everyone▁wins▁here,▁right?
I▁wasn't▁ready to▁let a▁political▁stunt▁interfere▁with my▁beauty▁sleep.
The▁first is▁debt▁relief for the▁poorest▁countries in the▁world.
These▁stars▁are normal like the Sun. Age,▁everything was normal.
But▁basically,▁it's the▁game we just▁played.
▁They▁extract▁what▁they can,▁which is▁mostly the▁metals --▁circuit▁boards and so▁forth -- and▁they▁leave▁behind▁mostly▁what▁they can't▁recover,▁which is,▁again,▁mostly the▁plastics.
And for▁some▁people, we▁gave▁them▁Legos and we▁said, "Hey,▁would you like to▁build▁this Bionicle for▁three▁dollars?
I▁have▁come to▁think▁it's▁one of the▁most▁powerful▁brain▁systems on Earth for▁both▁great▁joy and▁great▁sorrow.
I’m▁working a▁lot▁with▁motion and▁animation, and also I'm an▁old DJ and a▁musician.
▁Then 10,000▁years▁ago,▁exploiting a▁sudden▁change in global▁climate▁with the▁end of the▁last▁ice▁age,▁humans▁learned to▁farm.
In China,▁where▁everyone and▁everything is in a▁hurry, you▁need to▁outperform▁over 1.3▁billion▁other▁people to▁build a▁better▁life.
It's the▁fifth▁time I stand on▁this▁shore, the▁Cuban▁shore,▁looking▁out▁at that▁distant▁horizon,▁believing,▁again, that I'm▁going to▁make▁it all the▁way▁across that▁vast,▁dangerous▁wilderness of an▁ocean.
(Laughter)▁If we▁ask Einstein, he▁would▁say, "Whether the▁cow▁crossed the▁road,▁or the▁road▁moved▁underneath the▁cow,▁depends on your▁frame of▁reference."
But we▁couldn't▁satisfy▁it.
And▁again, I▁say that not to▁attack▁any▁industry, I▁think -- I▁really do -- I love my▁airplane, and▁cars on▁highways▁moving 60▁miles an▁hour▁are▁extraordinarily▁efficient,▁both▁from an▁engineering▁point of▁view, an▁energy▁consumption▁point of▁view, and a▁utility▁point of▁view.
So▁within▁five to▁seven▁years, I▁see▁us▁having a▁capacity to be▁completely▁present▁throughout the▁ocean and▁have all of that▁connected to the Internet, so we can▁reach▁many,▁many▁folks.
So -- the▁life▁record of a▁blog is▁something that I find▁incredibly▁important.
The▁bronze is▁nice▁hard,▁durable▁material that▁could▁roll on the▁ground.
But I▁see in the▁dark, I▁see▁his▁arms▁go▁limp and▁his▁head▁turns▁back, like,▁towards me.
And I▁said,▁Never.
"We▁were▁living in▁complete▁chaos," Eleanor▁said.
▁When I▁first▁learned the▁statistics, I was▁pretty▁stunned▁at▁how▁bad▁things▁are.
So I▁have to▁click▁it▁right▁now.
▁Another▁way to look▁at▁this is to▁think of▁world▁GDP▁over the▁last 10,000▁years, I've▁actually▁taken the▁trouble to▁plot▁this for you in a▁graph.
▁This is the▁main▁pedestrian▁mall; we▁did▁it in 72▁hours.▁Yes, you▁have to be fast.
▁BF:▁Thank you. RB:▁Thank you.
We▁were▁giving▁them all▁sorts of▁reasons to▁adapt▁new▁ways.
I▁didn't use▁it▁as a▁special▁effect,▁but▁as a▁partner on▁stage.
But▁what▁if we▁have▁it▁backwards?
▁This is Starbucks, you▁know.
Last▁but not least, the Stasi▁had▁its▁own▁armed▁forces.
Not just on▁people,▁but▁actually▁inanimate▁objects▁as▁well.
▁Which▁leaves the▁question,▁what▁are the▁big▁causes of▁happiness?
You can▁take all▁kinds of▁curves, and▁they're all▁pointing▁up.
(Applause) And▁once you▁have the▁basics, we can▁make a▁slightly▁more▁complicated▁circuit.
(Laughter) (Applause) Or▁something like that.
▁This is▁about▁attitude.
Dr.▁Bodnar▁came to the▁ceremony and▁she▁explained that▁she▁grew▁up in Ukraine.
And▁as a▁consequence of that▁presumption, my▁hometown was▁burned to the▁ground▁by an invading▁army, an▁experience that▁has befallen▁many a▁Hungarian▁town and▁village▁throughout▁its▁long and▁troubled▁history.
And I▁built an▁app▁out of▁it, a▁game▁out of▁it, in▁which▁children can▁play▁with▁words and▁with a▁reinforcement, a▁sound▁reinforcement of▁visual▁structures,▁they're▁able to▁learn▁language.
For▁instance, the▁number▁theory of▁British▁mathematician Gottfried Hardy,▁who▁had▁boasted that▁none of▁his▁work▁would▁ever be▁found▁useful in▁describing▁any▁phenomena in the real▁world,▁helped▁establish▁cryptography.
And▁where the▁diver is,▁this is▁probably▁where▁most of the▁reefs of the▁world▁are▁now,▁with▁very▁few▁corals,▁algae▁overgrowing the▁corals,▁lots of▁bacteria, and▁where the▁large▁animals▁are▁gone.
There▁are▁midterm▁elections that▁come▁incredibly fast▁after a▁presidency▁begins.
Don't▁worry, we're▁working▁with the▁authorities to▁deal▁with▁this and▁many,▁many▁other▁problems in the▁region.
▁How▁does▁this▁work?
I▁used to▁say we all▁belong to the global▁village.
It▁connects▁humans to▁other▁humans in a▁profound▁way that I've▁never▁seen▁before in▁any▁other▁form of▁media.
▁That's the▁way to handle▁this.
And▁every▁time▁there's a▁galaxy --▁at▁its▁location▁there's a▁galaxy -- and▁if we▁know▁anything▁about the▁galaxy,▁which we do,▁because▁there's a▁redshift▁measurement and▁everything, you▁put in the▁type of▁galaxy and the▁color, so▁this is the real▁representation.
▁When we▁have extreme El Nino▁events, you▁see all▁this▁red, and you▁see no▁green▁out▁here▁around the Galapagos.
And on▁Sunday▁morning the▁neighbors▁leaf▁blower▁comes▁out, and I▁want to▁throttle▁them.
I've▁got to▁warn you: the▁sense in▁which my▁worldview is▁upbeat▁has▁always▁been▁kind of▁subtle,▁sometimes▁even▁elusive.
You can▁see the▁copper▁tips on▁these▁things.
(Laughter) But of▁course,▁this is a passive▁tail.
We▁hope to▁have that▁built▁this▁fall.
▁They▁were▁more▁interested in▁using▁it▁as a▁backdrop.
It was a▁step▁towards the▁unknown.
▁Seriously,▁if you▁have a▁calculator▁with you,▁raise your hand.
▁This▁beetle,▁unlike▁this▁chip▁bag▁here,▁this▁beetle▁uses▁one▁material,▁chitin.
We use a▁chip-based,▁continuous▁flow▁separation▁technique▁called▁deterministic lateral▁displacement.
And▁they're in your▁house.▁They're in your▁house.
And that was▁actually my original▁hypothesis.
It's a▁form of▁affection and love that is▁now no▁longer▁extant, yeah?
▁When▁people▁hear Alex▁speaking my▁words, do▁they▁experience a▁disconnect?
He▁put▁his hand on the▁throttle.
So that's▁sort of the▁part, and▁let me▁move on▁then and▁show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
The▁grainy▁thing in the▁middle▁with the▁head, the▁long▁body and a▁number of feet --▁this is the▁image of a▁prototypical▁phage.
And▁believe me,▁these▁are▁current▁pictures.
(Applause) and Sheryl Sandberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Jack Dorsey, and your▁employees and your▁investors,▁too.
So in the▁beginning the▁monkey▁could not▁perform▁this▁task▁at all.
▁Even▁after▁his▁father▁died, he was still▁trying to▁scratch that▁itch.
In Rio de Janeiro, I▁translated▁this▁Portuguese▁poem▁from Gabriela Tôrres▁Barbosa,▁who was▁giving an▁homage to the▁poor▁people of the▁favela, and▁then I▁painted▁it on the▁rooftop.
And the▁second is a▁phenomenon that▁males▁are▁very,▁very▁good▁at▁finding▁females.
You▁have no▁money▁because you▁have no▁source of▁income.
▁This is in 13▁hospitals in▁four▁countries, and▁since 2010, we've▁done▁well▁over 2,000▁surgeries▁with no▁clinically▁adverse▁events.
It's not▁about just▁five▁years --▁it's▁long-term▁investments.
▁When▁she was 10▁years▁old in 1927,▁she▁published her▁first▁book of▁poems▁called "The▁Janitor's Boy."
But▁what of▁survivors?
But I▁don't▁want you in the▁frame, I▁don't▁want you in the▁window, I▁want you▁through the▁window, I▁want you on the▁other▁side, in the▁world,▁inhabiting the▁world.
We all▁started▁as▁novices.
We've▁got to▁constrain▁income, the▁bonus▁culture▁incomes▁at the▁top.
The▁time▁it was Chris▁Connor▁singing "Lush Life" --▁how▁it▁brought▁back my▁college▁sweetheart, my▁first real love,▁who --▁till I▁left her --▁played the▁same▁record.
We▁knew we▁wanted▁something▁very▁precise,▁but GPS▁coordinates,▁latitude and▁longitude,▁were just▁too▁complicated.
But▁design a▁program of▁treatments▁specifically for you and▁help your▁body▁guide▁back to▁health --▁guide your▁body▁back to▁health.
Now,▁these▁are all▁material▁needs.
▁They can▁engage in▁language --▁or to▁stay▁out of the▁language▁wars,▁they're▁involved in▁intentional and referential▁communication in▁which▁they▁pay▁attention to the▁attitudes of▁those▁with▁whom▁they▁are▁speaking.
But▁this is the▁important▁stage in▁which that▁framework will get▁built, and so we▁want to all be▁thinking▁about▁it▁consciously▁now.
I▁mean,▁after all,▁aging is not a▁piece of▁cake.
It is▁actually▁safe to▁drink in▁moderation▁during▁pregnancy.
The▁idea was▁radical and▁helped to▁disprove the▁long-standing▁model of▁atoms▁as▁indivisible▁objects.
So▁if we▁add in a▁chimpanzee▁here, we will▁see▁more▁differences.
The▁first▁insight is that▁while the▁conscious▁mind▁writes the▁autobiography of▁our▁species, the▁unconscious▁mind▁does▁most of the▁work.
I▁asked her a little▁bit▁more▁about the▁cave and▁what▁she▁planned▁would▁happen▁once▁she▁went▁there, you▁know.
And▁this is▁what I▁call▁behavior-changing▁products:▁products,▁systems▁or▁services that▁intervene and▁solve▁these▁problems▁up▁front.
Take the▁magic▁carpet for a▁ride.
▁They▁took to▁it▁immediately, and▁now▁they▁are▁forces of▁nature.
There is all▁kinds of▁things we can do.
So you▁see, the▁range is▁really▁quite diverse.
We▁wanted to▁give▁people the▁tools to▁see that▁change and▁take▁action.
And the▁last▁possibility is▁what is▁known▁as▁confounding,▁because▁it▁confounds▁our▁ability to▁figure▁out▁what's▁going on.
▁This▁last▁view of▁cosmology is▁called the▁relational▁view.
▁Scientists▁have▁several▁theories▁about▁what's▁behind▁this▁deterioration,▁from▁actual▁brain▁shrinkage, the▁hippocampus▁loses 5% of▁its▁neurons▁every▁decade for a total▁loss of 20%▁by the▁time you're 80▁years▁old to the▁drop in the▁production of neurotransmitters, like▁acetylcholine,▁which is▁vital to▁learning and▁memory.
And so▁now,▁when I▁reflect▁back on my▁spiritual▁quest,▁even▁though I▁did not find God, I▁found a▁home in▁this:▁even▁today, in a▁world▁fractured▁by▁religious,▁ethnic,▁political,▁philosophical, and▁racial▁divides,▁even▁with all of▁our▁obvious▁differences,▁at the▁end of the▁day, and the▁most fundamental▁level, we▁are all the▁same.
But▁anyway,▁whether▁they▁say▁they're▁right▁or▁whatever, we▁have▁plenty of▁natural▁gas.
But to▁go on,▁here is a▁very▁good▁example to▁see.
▁This is an▁image of the▁planet Earth.
Not▁everyone can▁read▁music▁or▁owns a▁camera,▁but▁everyone can▁communicate in▁some▁way, and▁everyone▁has▁stories that the rest of▁us can▁learn▁from.
One▁needs a▁new▁method to▁explore all of the▁possibilities that▁are▁out▁there.
Swelling in the▁brain▁disrupts▁its normal▁function--▁causing▁symptoms like▁hearing▁loss and extreme light▁sensitivity.
So▁when you▁see that▁kind of▁thing --▁this is not▁something that you▁have to▁test.
And I▁think that▁this is▁something that▁oncologists and▁epidemiologists▁should be▁aware of in the▁future.
And▁when I▁awoke▁here, the▁sky was so▁cloudy.
(Shouts) And all▁those▁against.
Now▁if we▁achieved that 10-percent▁reduction▁across all▁three▁cohorts,▁then the▁investors get a▁seven and a half▁percent▁annualized▁return on▁their▁investment, and▁if we do▁better▁than that,▁they can get▁up to 13▁percent▁annualized▁return on▁their▁investment,▁which is okay.
We▁should use▁machines that bring▁our▁work▁back▁into the▁world.
So I▁spoke▁out on▁youth▁unemployment and▁education and the▁neglect of the▁marginalized and▁disenfranchised.
▁Before we do▁any▁social▁critique,▁it is▁necessary▁really to▁lift that▁veil of▁obviousness and to▁think▁through a little▁bit▁differently.
I▁propose to you that▁matter that can▁evolve is▁alive, and▁this▁gives▁us the▁idea of▁making▁evolvable▁matter.
In▁those▁days,▁nobody▁had▁bank▁accounts,▁or American Express▁cards,▁or▁hedge▁funds.
Now, I like the▁idea of online▁dating,▁because▁it's▁predicated on an▁algorithm, and that's▁really just a simple▁way of▁saying I've▁got a▁problem, I'm▁going to use▁some▁data,▁run▁it▁through a▁system and get to a▁solution.
I▁don't▁want to▁say a▁five-year-old▁should be▁allowed to▁consent to▁sex▁or▁consent to▁marry.
(Laughter) I was▁pretty▁good in▁reading,▁but▁religion and▁musical▁appreciation▁needed▁more▁work.
There was▁this▁big▁sort of▁bumpy-looking▁virus on the▁cover, and I just▁wanted to▁read▁it. I▁picked▁up that▁book, and▁as we▁drove▁from the▁edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur, and to,▁actually,▁here▁where we▁are▁today, in Monterey, I▁read that▁book, and▁from▁when I was▁reading that▁book, I▁knew that I▁wanted to▁have a▁life in▁medicine.
I▁don't▁have the▁room for▁this in my▁house,▁but I▁had to▁finish▁what I▁had▁started.
"These▁are▁children.
One▁hundred▁twenty-five▁girls will not be▁married▁when▁they're 12▁years▁old.
We▁first▁captured the▁dynamics▁with a▁set of▁differential▁equations.
My▁master▁took me to▁set▁ovens▁because▁this was▁part of▁oven-making,▁oven-setting, in the▁time.
You▁carve▁them in▁blocks and▁then you▁pile▁them on▁top of▁one▁another, and▁they▁support▁weight.
Who▁knows▁what▁other▁forms of intelligent▁life▁are▁possible,▁or▁how▁they▁process the▁world▁around▁them.
You▁have to▁have▁those▁steps.▁If you▁have -- It's▁easy to get▁kids▁interested in▁science.
And we▁did▁this▁passively▁by▁looking▁at▁whether▁or not▁they'd▁gone to▁university▁health▁services.
▁Any▁time I'm▁ready to▁go,▁any▁time I open▁up my▁medicine▁cabinet, you will▁see Ban▁deodorant.
▁That's a▁lot of▁people to▁have a▁lot of▁problems -- and▁this is▁even in so-called▁nerve-sparing▁surgery,▁which▁means that the▁surgeon is▁aware of the▁problem, and▁they▁are▁trying to▁avoid the▁nerves.
AA: So on September 14, 2015, a▁date that's▁definitely▁going to live in my▁memory, LIGO▁heard▁this: [Whirring▁sound] So▁if you▁know▁how to▁listen, that is the▁sound of -- (Audio)▁SH: ...▁two▁black▁holes,▁each of▁about 30 solar▁masses, that▁were▁whirling▁around▁at a rate▁comparable to▁what▁goes on in your▁blender.
You▁could▁think of▁it▁personally in your▁own▁terms, of▁how you▁might use▁it.
▁When he was a little▁puppy, he▁puts▁his▁paws on your leg -- you▁know,▁isn't that▁nice?
The▁advantage of▁volume,▁first, just▁has to do▁with the▁complexity of the▁world▁nowadays.
▁Another▁example:▁Nassau▁groupers in Belize in the▁Mesoamerican Reef.
I can▁make my▁own▁purpose.
And I▁know, in the light of▁human▁suffering and▁poverty and▁even▁climate▁change,▁one▁would▁wonder,▁why▁worry▁about a▁few▁cats?
▁This is▁what we▁run▁at the▁office, that▁actually▁runs real▁time.
And so I▁started that▁swim in a▁bathing▁suit like normal, and, no▁joke,▁this is▁it;▁it▁came▁from the▁shark▁divers.
▁Three,▁four,▁five,▁six.▁Then I▁calculate -- yeah,▁good.
▁That's 40▁billion▁dollars a▁year▁wasted on▁electricity that▁does not▁contribute to▁our▁well-being▁but▁does▁contribute to▁climate▁change.
And▁how -- (Applause) And▁how can we▁empower▁survivors▁if we're▁making▁them feel▁less▁than?
▁They▁had normal▁heights.
No▁longer can we just▁sit and▁understand▁elephant▁societies▁or▁study just▁how to▁stop the▁ivory▁trade,▁which is▁horrific and still▁ongoing.
Or you▁sit▁down in▁front of▁it like you▁would do in▁front your TV▁set.
▁Those▁are the▁three▁most▁important▁economies in Asia.
(Laughter) And▁now the▁third▁time for the▁same▁player.
You re-grow a▁set of▁teeth.
So my▁wife and I▁decided to▁film▁it and▁try to▁show▁another▁side of▁it,▁mostly to▁make▁people▁want to▁go▁into the▁water.
So▁what▁does a "scientific▁mind" do in the▁arts?
We▁need▁each▁other to▁remember, to▁help▁each▁other▁remember, that▁grief is▁this▁multitasking▁emotion.
World▁over,▁teams of▁researchers▁are▁decoding▁its▁biological▁principles to▁understand▁its▁computational▁rules and▁applying that▁learning to the▁fields of▁electronics,▁programming and▁robotics.
And▁if you can▁make▁yourself▁symmetrical, you're▁sending▁out a▁sign that you've▁got▁good▁genes, you've▁got a▁good▁upbringing and▁therefore you'll▁make a▁good▁mate.
Okay, you get my▁point,▁right? (Laughter) You're▁getting▁better,▁but▁it's▁hard.▁Why is▁it▁hard?
For▁instance, the▁word▁astronomy,▁which▁seems a▁bit bizarre▁where▁it is, is▁actually▁exactly▁where▁it▁should be,▁between▁what▁it is, an▁actual▁science, and▁between▁what▁it▁describes, the▁astronomical▁terms.
And the sum▁looks like▁this.
▁How▁are we▁going to▁build all of▁this?
I▁learned▁very▁few▁things in▁addition▁since (Laughter) --▁but▁made a▁whole▁number of▁them▁into▁projects▁since.
▁She's an▁artist.
And I'll▁keep▁doing▁this for▁Patrícia, my▁namesake,▁one of the▁first▁tapirs we▁captured and▁monitored in the Atlantic Forest▁many,▁many▁years▁ago; for Rita and her▁baby Vincent in the Pantanal.
It's▁very▁different▁than▁saying, "We're a▁twelve-foot-high▁truck▁trying to get▁under a▁ten-foot▁bridge, and we can just▁sort of▁squeeze▁under."
Two▁years▁ago, my▁younger▁sister▁came▁out of▁remission▁from a▁rare▁blood▁cancer, and the only▁treatment▁left for her was a▁bone▁marrow▁transplant.
But for▁us,▁it▁would▁have▁been▁insane not to▁go.
I▁hope.
▁Although we▁may▁strive for▁harmony and▁consensus, in▁many▁situations,▁error and▁disagreement▁should be▁naturally▁expected.
And he was▁writing▁his▁blog▁one▁day, and▁his▁wife▁gave▁birth to her▁baby▁at 25▁weeks.
But India still▁has a▁lot of▁work to do in▁terms of▁gender▁equality.
▁What▁if w = 1? The▁error is 4.
There's a▁dash▁there.
And▁they▁are▁going to▁have▁poor▁reading▁skills.
It▁does not▁take▁too▁much▁rocket▁science to▁actually▁try to▁create▁new▁laws to▁mandate,▁if you're▁going to▁have the▁privilege of▁accessing▁our high▁seas▁resources, we▁need to▁know --▁someone▁needs to▁know --▁where you▁are and▁what you're▁doing.
▁Those▁are a▁collection of▁deep▁brain▁regions that▁regulate▁movement,▁through a▁neurochemical▁called▁dopamine.
So, we▁build the▁carbon▁banks on the▁planet,▁renew the▁soils.
And▁it is the▁product of a▁complex▁historical▁process,▁one▁which▁has▁gained▁ground▁with the▁rise of▁Islamic▁conservatism▁since the▁late 1970s.
And▁why is▁it▁found▁at▁such a high▁frequency▁within▁this▁particular▁population?
And I'm▁treating you, my▁inner▁circle, like you're the▁enemy.
(Laughter) But▁then I▁saw▁this▁guy.
The▁hall▁seats▁two-and-a-half▁thousand▁people.
I▁want the▁justices to▁have the▁very▁same▁reaction that I▁had▁when you▁brought▁this▁issue to me▁seven▁years▁ago."
He's▁definitely the▁star of my▁show.
We▁don't▁really▁choose to▁allow that to▁cause▁there to be a shift in▁our▁hearts.
Or, "Look! There's a▁banana▁tree▁over▁there!▁Let's▁go and get▁bananas!"
Your▁father is▁murdered.
And▁when I▁saw the▁street on the 25th, I▁went▁back and▁said, "Egypt▁before the 25th is▁never▁going to be▁Egypt▁after the 25th.
LT: No,▁exactly.▁That▁shows you just▁how▁limited▁Aristotle was.
▁What's the▁theme?▁What's the▁pattern?
So I▁never▁know▁who's▁going to be in the▁picture,▁if▁it's▁going to be a▁great▁sunrise▁or▁sunset -- no▁control.
So,▁this▁trauma --▁what is▁it?
The▁problem is not that the▁poor▁don't get▁laws,▁it's that▁they▁don't get▁law▁enforcement.
Now▁it's▁at▁this▁time that Detroit▁begins to▁see a▁second▁kind of▁migration, a▁migration to the▁suburbs.
Light▁increases▁levels of▁alertness and will▁delay▁sleep.
▁What we're▁really▁here to▁talk▁about is the "how."
He is▁viewed▁by▁many▁as the▁founder of the▁probability▁theory, and a▁creator of the▁first▁model of a computer.
So▁people▁know that▁it's▁there.
And▁when we're backstage, we▁give an▁answer that▁maybe▁makes▁it▁seem like that.
▁Well, for me▁cymatics is an▁almost▁magical▁tool.
▁Wouldn't▁it be▁great▁if the▁technology we▁used to▁take▁care of▁ourselves was▁as▁good▁as the▁technology we use to▁make▁money?
But▁after▁some▁time,▁after▁some▁months,▁one▁day▁as I was▁going▁out and▁about,▁suddenly I▁noticed▁hundreds of▁dragonflies,▁hundreds of▁dragonflies.
▁Actually,▁it▁gets▁weirder -- I was in the▁museum of▁science▁at the▁time the▁tornado▁hit,▁playing▁with the▁tornado▁display -- (Laughter) so I▁missed her▁call.
We're▁looking▁at▁crystal▁lattices to▁see the▁bonding▁process in▁this.
And I▁turn to Caroline, and▁she's▁crying her▁eyes▁out.
We▁have an▁attitude that▁support▁groups▁are inherently▁beneficial.
Now,▁why do you▁have to▁consume the▁tea?
The▁problem▁with▁this▁model is▁there▁are▁some▁amazing▁messages that▁need to be▁said, that▁aren't profitable to▁say.
It's a▁terrific▁story.
So▁if you▁add▁these▁two▁together,▁alone, you can▁see a▁separation that▁nuclear▁puts▁out▁at least▁nine to 17▁times▁more CO2▁equivalent▁emissions▁than▁wind▁energy.
It's▁very▁uncomfortable to be on the▁receiving▁end of that▁kind of▁language.
So▁people▁are▁walking▁around▁with▁this▁virus▁showing no▁signs.
And▁as you just▁mentioned,▁there's▁lots of▁choices▁out▁there that▁are▁very▁visual▁these▁days.
▁That you're▁much▁better▁off,▁almost▁universally,▁looking for a▁low-cost▁or▁locally▁applicable▁version of the▁newest▁technology.
I▁have a▁confession to▁make.
Paul Piff: OK, so no▁surprises,▁people▁are on to▁us.
▁Liquid▁metal▁battery is designed to▁operate▁at▁elevated▁temperature▁with▁minimum▁regulation.
I▁don't▁see▁anybody▁actually▁being▁able to do that▁very▁effectively.
And▁what you can▁see is that▁over the▁last 25▁years,▁Greece▁has▁barely▁managed to▁save▁more▁than 10▁percent of▁their▁GDP.
But▁what Galileo▁saw was a▁rocky,▁barren▁world,▁which he▁expressed▁through▁his▁watercolor▁painting.
▁This is▁SymbioticA, and▁they've▁been▁working --▁they▁were the▁first▁ones to do▁this in-vitro▁meat -- and▁now▁they've also▁done an in-vitro▁coat, a▁leather▁coat.
So▁if you▁met an▁educationalist and▁said, "I can▁improve▁education▁attendance▁rates▁by 25▁percent▁with just▁one simple▁thing," you'd▁make a▁lot of▁friends in▁education.
So, we▁pushed the▁piles▁down▁through the▁dune, and we▁create an initial▁bacterial▁surface.
My▁interest was in▁whether the▁environment▁had▁changed.
(Laughter) And▁when▁they▁were▁about▁five and▁six,▁four and▁five, Jay▁could▁come to me,▁come to me▁crying.
My▁colleague Dan Freeman▁has▁used a▁range of▁agents▁which▁have▁stabilized▁sleep and▁reduced▁levels of▁paranoia in▁those▁individuals▁by 50▁percent.
▁This▁could be the▁pattern that▁leaders▁follow▁again and▁again▁when we▁deal▁with▁these▁complex,▁cross-border▁problems,▁whether▁it's▁climate▁change,▁whether▁it's▁migration,▁whether▁it's the▁financial▁system.
It's the▁common▁currency of▁being a▁human▁being.
But▁when Sarah Jones▁asked me to▁please▁come to TED, I▁said,▁well, you▁know,▁first, I▁don't▁know that, you▁know --▁before▁two▁years▁ago, you▁would not find me in▁front of an▁audience of▁people,▁much▁less like▁this▁because I▁did not like to▁give▁speeches▁because I feel that,▁as an▁immigrant, I do not▁have▁good English▁skills for▁speaking.
For▁example, the▁waves that▁hit▁us on September 14 -- and▁yes,▁every▁single▁one of you▁stretched and▁compressed▁under the▁action of that▁wave --▁when the▁waves▁hit,▁they▁stretched the▁average▁person▁by▁one▁part in 10 to the 21.
It was▁anarchy.
And the▁more▁technical▁topics,▁such▁as▁architecture,▁materials and,▁strangely▁enough,▁men,▁those▁are not▁good▁topics to▁talk▁about.
You're▁avoiding▁outside▁areas,▁or you're▁closing your▁window.
The▁size of▁organisms▁increases a▁third, so your▁fish▁are▁now▁this▁big.
(Laughter) But▁something▁happened that▁made me▁realize that▁reality▁may not be▁reality.
The▁good▁news is that the▁quality of▁leadership in Africa▁has▁been▁improving.
▁Once you get the▁formula▁right you can▁replicate▁it.
(Music) (Music▁ends) Now,▁what▁happened was not▁maybe▁what you▁thought,▁which is, he▁suddenly▁became▁passionate,▁engaged,▁involved,▁got a▁new▁teacher, he▁hit▁puberty,▁or▁whatever▁it is.
Now,▁while▁as a▁journalist, Miller's▁archive▁may▁have▁been▁better▁written and▁more▁carefully▁curated▁than▁most, the▁fact of the▁matter is that all of▁us▁today▁are▁creating an▁archive that's▁something▁completely▁different▁than▁anything that's▁been▁created▁by▁any▁previous▁generation.
Your▁home▁phone, your▁work▁phone, your▁cell▁phone, your▁yacht▁phone (this is the▁EG▁crowd).
▁This is▁some▁work that we're▁doing,▁led▁by▁one of▁our▁collaborators, Alan Horsager▁at USC, and▁being▁sought to be▁commercialized▁by a▁start-up▁company, Eos▁Neuroscience,▁which is▁funded▁by the NIH.
And we're▁often not▁taught to▁recognize the sin in▁ourselves, in that we're not▁taught in▁this▁culture▁how to▁wrestle▁with▁it,▁how to▁confront▁it, and▁how to▁combat▁it.
We all▁have to▁improve on▁this▁sort of▁thing.
There's so▁much extra▁energy in the▁atmosphere,▁there's so▁much extra▁water▁vapor.
▁That▁good▁thing you just▁did,▁whoo!
So▁let's▁quickly▁recap▁this▁cycle of▁odds.
And I am▁hoping that▁many of you will▁respond to▁this.
In a▁way,▁why not?
▁What do I▁mean▁by▁fluent?
The real▁surprise,▁this is the▁big▁one, was that▁there was▁connectivity▁out in the▁forest.
▁As I▁said, I just▁went▁back to▁school, and I am▁considering▁majoring in▁urban▁studies and▁then▁going on to▁urban▁planning,▁kind of▁taking▁whatever I've▁learned▁from online▁communities and▁trying to▁adapt that to a▁physical community.
But▁at▁home, I was▁being▁taught▁something▁entirely▁different.
▁Where▁are the rest of the Swahili▁speakers?
And▁what's▁good is,▁unlike in the▁experiments that Hal and▁myself ran▁with Russ Smith, you▁don't▁have to▁program▁these▁by▁yourself in▁order to▁see the▁virtual▁reality.
We▁were▁totally▁dependent▁during▁those▁years on▁this▁amazing▁acronym,▁which is▁MAD.
Microsoft▁actually▁did▁this▁experiment.
It's▁hard to▁grasp,▁but▁it's an▁incredible▁fact.
(Laughter)▁When the▁male▁brain▁works▁well,▁it▁works▁extremely▁well.
You've▁heard that▁saying.
I've▁been▁digging▁through the▁literature for the original▁reference for that▁number, and I▁could▁never find▁it.
But we▁rarely do that▁when we're▁having a▁bad▁day, and▁something▁horrible is▁happening.
You▁might▁say, "Well▁there's▁nothing▁there to be▁living,"▁but that's not▁right.
▁Well, the Earth --▁our▁environment, in the▁form of▁us -- is▁creating▁knowledge.
So▁people▁believe▁now that Titan is▁most▁likely▁what we▁call a pre-biotic▁planet,▁because▁it's so▁cold▁organic▁material▁did not get to the▁stage of▁becoming▁biological▁material, and▁therefore▁life▁could▁have▁evolved on▁it.
And▁indeed,▁these▁days I▁harbor▁new▁hopes.
▁That's▁right --▁it's a▁ratio of▁one to a▁thousand.
All▁right,▁now for▁some▁more▁sound▁data.
▁Every▁year▁when▁it▁comes to the▁cotton▁harvest, the▁government▁shuts▁down the▁schools,▁puts the▁kids in▁buses,▁buses▁them to the▁cotton▁fields to▁spend▁three▁weeks▁harvesting the▁cotton.
I still▁remember the▁photo.
We're▁actually▁pretty▁bad▁at▁figuring▁out▁who's a▁taker,▁especially on▁first▁impressions.
▁Does▁this▁then▁mean that▁there is▁after all▁some absolute▁difference▁between▁people▁outside Africa and▁inside Africa in that▁people▁outside Africa▁have▁this▁old▁component in▁their▁genome▁from▁these▁extinct▁forms of▁humans,▁whereas▁Africans do not?
▁Together▁with▁our▁collaborators▁at Harvard and MIT, we▁embedded▁bacteria that▁were▁genetically▁engineered to▁rapidly▁capture▁carbon▁from the▁atmosphere and▁convert▁it▁into▁sugar.
▁According to▁legend,▁she was the▁first▁mortal▁woman,▁whose▁blazing▁curiosity▁set a▁chain of▁earth-shattering▁events in▁motion.
So▁with real-time▁storytelling,▁blurring the▁lines▁between▁fact and▁fiction, the real▁world and the digital▁world, flexible▁identity,▁anonymity,▁these▁are all▁tools that we▁have▁accessible to▁us, and I▁think that▁they're just the▁building▁blocks.
We're just▁going to▁run▁through all the▁old▁ones and▁watch▁them▁five▁times▁because▁they're so▁true.
▁Are▁these▁factors▁taken▁into▁consideration▁when land-use▁policy is▁decided?
And▁if▁tempers▁are still▁too high,▁then▁they▁send▁someone▁off to▁visit▁some▁relatives,▁as a▁cooling-off▁period.
And in▁many▁areas,▁they▁don't▁exist.
▁They▁stole▁our▁flag!▁They▁stole▁our▁flag!"
It was in▁front of the▁whole▁class and I▁felt▁dreadful.
These▁stories▁saturated my▁cells and▁nerves, and to be▁honest, I▁stopped▁sleeping for▁three▁years.
Leading▁with▁beauty▁means▁rising▁above▁what is▁merely▁necessary.
Each▁one is an▁archive of▁our▁culture,▁through▁our▁ripped-up▁media and▁matter,▁whether▁it's▁encyclopedias▁or▁dictionaries▁or▁magazines.
But▁it was▁fun▁anyway.
The▁pictures that▁came a▁bit▁later▁had a▁very simple▁reason.
▁Instead▁what▁it's▁allowed is▁silos of▁interest.

We can▁see▁it▁at▁work in the▁earliest▁stages of▁human▁history.
India is a▁good▁place to do▁such an▁experiment in,▁because we▁have all the▁ethnic▁diversities, all the -- you▁know, the▁genetic▁diversity, all the▁racial▁diversities, and also all the▁socio-economic▁diversities.
(Laughter) I▁said, "I'm a▁hedge▁fund▁executive▁bank▁manager."
You▁know▁it▁costs a▁lot of▁money and so on,▁but▁yes,▁it▁should not▁play▁it▁safe.
But▁there is a▁happy▁ending to▁this▁story.
We can▁start,▁if you▁want,▁by▁understanding --▁it's just to▁start,▁it's not▁interesting,▁but --▁how I▁work.
▁Nothing▁ever▁turns▁out▁as▁planned ...▁ever.
▁Some▁came▁from the▁winning▁party.

(Laughter) So just to▁give you a▁bit of▁context,▁as▁June▁said, I'm an▁artist, a▁technologist and an▁educator.
We▁as a▁world▁are▁faced▁with a▁problem.
It's▁risky and▁it's▁going to be▁one hell of a▁ride --▁better▁than Disney.
▁They, in▁these▁papers,▁explained to▁their▁fellow▁doctors▁who▁perform▁colonoscopies,▁how to▁minimize the▁chance that▁when you▁perform a▁colonoscopy, your▁patient will▁explode. (Laughter) Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan▁one of the▁authors,▁flew in▁from Paris to the▁ceremony,▁where he▁explained the▁history of▁this, that in the 1950s,▁when▁colonoscopies▁were▁becoming a▁common▁technique for the▁first▁time,▁people▁were▁figuring▁out▁how to do▁it▁well.
You▁translate that to the▁building▁industry.
▁Try▁one of▁two▁conditions.
▁This was not▁something that▁happened▁with▁regularity▁back▁then in 1998, and▁by "this," I▁mean the▁stealing of▁people's private▁words,▁actions,▁conversations▁or▁photos, and▁then▁making▁them▁public --▁public▁without▁consent,▁public▁without▁context and▁public▁without▁compassion.

▁Anglo-Americans,▁they▁did▁two and a half▁times▁more▁anagrams▁when▁they▁got to▁choose▁them,▁as▁compared to▁when▁it was▁chosen for▁them▁by Miss Smith▁or▁their▁mothers.
▁Because I just▁keep▁thinking of▁going that fast and▁having your▁whole▁face▁smushed▁backwards.
Now, the▁group I▁really▁want you to▁think▁about,▁though,▁are the▁ones▁at the▁bottom -- the▁foot▁soldiers.
▁Imagine a▁student▁taking a▁giant▁test for▁three▁full▁days.
▁Punch▁clocks▁are▁becoming▁obsolete,▁as▁are▁career▁ladders.
We▁emailed▁out▁letters to▁as▁many▁people▁as we▁could --▁several▁people in the▁audience▁here --▁who▁were▁very▁helpful.
▁Class▁sizes▁are▁smaller▁than in▁many▁countries.
▁Why▁don't we▁train▁our▁children in▁compassion?
(Laughter) After "Germany Talks," we▁got▁approached▁by▁many international▁media▁outlets, and we▁decided▁this▁time to▁build a▁serious and▁secure▁platform.
▁Well, we're▁going to use a 3D▁printer.
I was▁curious▁about▁this, so▁it▁led me to the▁work of a▁Danish▁physicist▁called Tor Norretranders, and he▁converted the▁bandwidth of the▁senses▁into computer▁terms.
But▁one of the▁puzzles▁this▁has▁revealed is that▁factors like▁these▁don't▁seem to▁have a▁particularly▁strong▁effect.
And also, I▁thought that▁there▁would be▁synthetic▁polymers,▁plastics,▁embedded in the▁rock.
So▁when▁it▁comes to your▁dog▁or your▁cat▁or▁maybe your▁one-armed▁monkey that you▁happen to▁know,▁if you▁think that▁they▁are▁traumatized▁or▁depressed, you're▁probably▁right.
He▁said, "Did you▁quit▁or▁were you▁fired?"
Again, I'll use the▁words in the▁same▁order he▁did.
▁They▁were like,▁well,▁maybe we can▁reuse▁those▁graves▁after 50▁years.
▁Let me▁start▁with the▁study that▁made me▁rethink my▁whole▁approach to stress.
Next▁part of the▁cold▁history▁lesson, the▁lovely▁picture of the▁British▁Industrial Revolution.
It will not▁take▁us▁where we▁want to▁go.
It's like▁doing extra-vehicular▁activity in▁space,▁but▁at▁much▁greater▁distances, and▁at▁much▁greater▁physical▁peril.
Or▁this▁machine▁here,▁it's▁from the DIY bio▁movement, and▁it's▁one of the▁steps that you▁need in▁order to▁process DNA, and▁again,▁it's▁completely open-source▁from the▁ground▁up.
▁Come on,▁they live in▁big▁houses,▁they▁have▁big▁cars.
Like▁air,▁climate▁change is▁simultaneously▁at the▁scale of the▁molecule, the▁breath and the▁planet.
And that's▁exactly▁what we▁were aiming for.
▁Sometimes I▁think▁back to that▁night in the E.R.
And I▁shouldn't be miserable.
▁How do you get▁something that you can't▁afford?
It▁breeds▁this▁uranium▁as▁it▁goes▁along, so▁it's▁kind of like a▁candle.
▁Most▁spiders use▁copious▁amounts of▁silk, and▁silk is▁essential to▁their▁survival and▁reproduction.
▁Thank you.▁Thank you. (Applause)
▁However, we do▁know▁one▁thing that▁definitely▁doesn't▁work.
Specialized▁skills and▁facilitation▁skills▁are the▁combination that▁leads to▁strong▁success.
And I▁did▁one that was▁about 35 feet▁long.
And▁then▁something▁occurred to me: There▁has to be an▁easier▁way,▁because▁it's the▁patients▁who▁are the▁most in▁need of▁access to▁eye▁care▁who▁are the least▁likely to get▁it.
▁Let me▁conclude▁with▁this▁picture.
I▁dare▁say▁it's a▁pittance,▁what▁it▁would▁require for▁us to▁really▁begin to▁solve▁some of▁these▁problems.
But▁first I▁want to▁tell you▁how▁they▁were▁discovered.
In▁fact, 15 Exos can fit on a▁single semi▁truck▁by▁itself.
And that was▁fine. We▁got wet. No▁problem.

▁They▁need to be▁part of the▁pack.
It's▁Saturday. It's the▁holidays."
Now, the online▁tools to▁make the▁exchange▁as▁easy and▁as▁instinctive▁as the▁street,▁they're▁getting▁there.
Sorry.▁What?
With▁friendly AI, we▁could▁simply▁build all of▁these▁societies and▁give▁people the▁freedom to▁choose▁which▁one▁they▁want to live in▁because we▁would no▁longer be▁limited▁by▁our▁intelligence,▁merely▁by the▁laws of▁physics.
▁That's▁when we▁wondered:▁if we,▁being so▁well▁educated,▁were so▁ill-informed▁about▁menstruation,▁there▁would be▁millions of▁girls▁out▁there▁who▁would be▁ill-informed,▁too.
It▁has to▁basically do▁this on▁current land.
And we▁don't▁typically▁challenge▁why▁men's▁work is▁advantaged.
▁If you▁leave a $50▁check▁after▁dinner▁with▁friends, you▁don't▁increase the▁probability of▁being▁invited▁back.
And so you can▁imagine,▁even in▁this▁application, that in a high-rise▁building▁where the▁panel▁systems▁go▁from▁floor to▁floor▁up to 30, 40▁floors, the▁entire▁surface▁could be▁differentiated▁at▁different▁times of▁day▁depending on▁how that▁sun▁moves▁across and▁hits that▁surface.
▁Well,▁after▁many Apollo▁projects of▁our▁own,▁launching the▁largest▁fleet of▁satellites in▁human▁history, we▁have▁reached▁our▁target.
And▁if you look▁at the▁name of▁one of▁those▁streets,▁Bread Street, you can▁tell▁what was▁going on▁there 300▁years▁ago.
You▁bodies▁are▁wonderful▁as▁they▁are.
▁Our▁local▁journalists▁are▁our▁mentors.
▁That's 10▁percent of the CO2▁emissions▁across▁their▁entire▁country.
I've still▁got the▁drive and▁vision.
So▁now that you're all▁experts on▁protocells, we're▁going to▁play a▁game▁with▁these▁protocells.
And▁these▁companies▁have the▁right to▁say "no."
And▁as a▁parent, I just can't▁imagine▁what that▁does to your▁soul.
And▁since▁clue▁four▁says the▁green-walled▁house▁must be▁directly to the▁left of the▁white-walled▁one,▁it can't be the▁first▁or▁fifth▁house▁either.
So I've▁gone▁from▁memory▁pioneer to▁exercise▁explorer.
Can we live▁here and▁now in▁our▁wired▁web and still▁follow▁those▁ancient▁instructions, "Know▁thyself?"
And for the▁sake of▁brevity, I'll▁call▁one▁country Country 1 and the▁other▁country Country 2.
And▁after▁one▁week,▁it's▁beating.

▁This is a▁cassette▁tape the▁girl▁puts▁into her▁cassette-tape▁player.
Like▁hunger and▁thirst,▁it's▁almost▁impossible to▁stamp▁out."
I also use▁it▁as a▁tool for▁visualizing and▁tracking▁pollution.
So▁people▁imagine the▁nervous▁system is just like that.
One of▁these▁plants is a▁spiky plant▁called▁sisal -- you▁may▁know▁this▁here▁as▁jute.
▁When you bring▁people▁into the▁laboratory and you▁ask▁them▁if▁they're▁willing to▁engage in▁safe▁but▁disgusting▁behaviors like▁eating▁chocolate that's▁been▁baked to look like▁dog▁poop,▁or in▁this▁case▁eating▁some▁mealworms that▁are▁perfectly▁healthy▁but▁pretty gross, your▁score on that▁scale▁actually▁predicts▁whether▁or not you'll be▁willing to▁engage in▁those▁behaviors.
So▁thank you▁very▁much.
And▁what I▁found was▁quite▁surprising.
And▁finally,▁Grandmother Jack▁says, "Farai,▁it▁seems to me that you▁have all the▁symptoms of▁kufungisisa."
▁If you▁shatter▁this▁fishbowl so that▁everything is▁possible, you▁decrease▁satisfaction.
And the▁trends for▁those▁who▁are▁at the▁periphery of▁our▁society,▁who▁are the▁poorest and the▁most▁vulnerable, the▁trends▁give▁rise to a▁great▁case for▁pessimism.
And the▁problem▁with that is that▁people▁freak▁out.
He▁had to▁go▁towards the▁water▁as the▁sirens▁sounded.
So▁what you▁see▁here is a▁previous▁version of Pleurobot that's▁completely▁controlled▁by▁our▁spinal▁cord▁model▁programmed on▁board of the▁robot.
Two -- and▁it was▁two of▁spades,▁right?
▁Here's Kallikuppam.
So the▁lamp is not just▁giving a light,▁it's also▁giving a▁darkness.
Now the▁second▁round of▁voting▁did not bring▁forth a▁clear▁winner▁either.
But▁she's not▁financially▁secure.
It's▁about▁making▁good▁products▁faster and▁cheaper.
Take▁this in.
And I▁went▁down and▁they▁rolled▁him▁into a▁room.
But▁what you all▁want to▁know is of▁course▁does▁this▁extend also to▁more▁complex,▁more▁meaningful▁choices?
Now,▁keep in▁mind▁this is▁conceptual. It's not a real▁product.
Oh, and that's not▁even the▁tip of the▁iceberg.
▁Wha --▁what do you do?"
In a▁number of▁cases▁they▁were▁even▁clinically▁depressed.
And▁then so▁she▁realized I▁couldn't▁catch live▁ones, so▁she▁brought me▁dead▁penguins.

Indirectly, we▁have▁saved the▁government of▁Jamaica▁five million▁dollars▁from▁people that▁would▁have▁gone to Miami▁or Atlanta for▁care.
But we▁have to be▁able to▁create and▁practice▁this▁ritual▁without▁harming the▁environment,▁which is▁why we▁need▁new▁options.
▁Betrayal▁runs▁deep.
We▁know▁about▁statistics,▁right?
We just▁need to▁deliver▁these to a▁pretty▁small▁area.
I▁take a little▁capillary, and you▁see▁it▁starts▁wicking in.
So Noam and I▁had▁this▁insight that▁if we▁want▁our▁students to▁understand▁how▁computers▁work, and▁understand▁it in the▁marrow of▁their▁bones,▁then▁perhaps the best▁way to▁go▁about▁it is to▁have▁them▁build a▁complete,▁working,▁general-purpose,▁useful computer,▁hardware and▁software,▁from the▁ground▁up,▁from▁first▁principles.
Nelson▁decided to▁become a▁treatment▁activist and▁join▁up▁with▁other▁groups.
I'm▁going to▁tell you▁one▁last▁thing in the▁last▁two▁minutes that's▁unpublished --▁it's▁going to▁come▁out▁tomorrow -- and▁it's an▁interesting▁case of▁how you▁might use▁this▁chip to find▁something▁new and open a▁new▁door.
▁That all▁changed▁with▁one▁incident.
(Laughter) (Applause) And we, in▁fact,▁when we▁have▁played▁this▁over the▁world.
▁Well, I like▁schools,▁but▁teachers▁tend to▁teach▁outdated▁worldviews,▁because▁they▁learned▁something▁when▁they▁went to▁school, and▁now▁they▁describe▁this▁world to the▁students▁without▁any▁bad▁intentions, and▁those▁books, of▁course, that▁are▁printed▁are▁outdated in a▁world that▁changes.
These Gapminder▁bubbles▁show you▁how the▁spread of the▁virus was in 1983 in the▁world,▁or▁how we▁estimate that▁it was.
Now that is▁foreplay.
I'm▁influenced▁by▁everything I▁read,▁everything I▁see.
Good▁afternoon,▁everybody.
There is no national▁entity▁or▁business▁group that is▁funding▁this▁research.
I was▁completely▁wrong.
It's your▁sense of▁smell, and▁it's▁breathtakingly▁powerful.
So he▁moved▁back to the▁farm, and,▁long▁story▁short,▁they▁now▁have▁seven▁acres▁under▁cultivation.
Look▁at▁what's▁been▁achieved.
In my▁broken English, and▁with a▁dictionary, I▁explained the▁situation, and▁without▁hesitating, the man▁went to the▁ATM, and he▁paid the rest of the▁money for my▁family, and▁two▁other North▁Koreans to get▁out of▁jail.
Ireland's▁potatoes▁were▁genetically▁identical.
And that is▁exactly▁what▁causes the▁warping of my▁visual▁image.
▁Maybe we can get that.
2016, the UN▁were▁looking for a▁brand▁new▁ambassador to▁represent▁women's▁empowerment and▁gender▁equality, and▁who▁did▁they▁choose?
It's not a digital▁interface,▁but a▁physical▁one:▁it's a▁hotel.
I▁suppose▁what you▁mean is:▁What▁happens to the▁boat▁while I'm▁sleeping?
▁If you look on▁this,▁imagine a▁piano▁keyboard.
These▁include, of▁course,▁climate.

You▁have to▁think▁about▁things like▁pause▁points.
So,▁here you▁go. (Laughter) Paragraph▁number▁two: You▁may▁actually▁have to just get▁very▁blunt and▁say▁what's▁really on your▁mind.
▁That was▁his▁idea of a▁performance-enhancing▁drug.
▁Well, that was the▁question that 19th▁century▁French▁physiologist▁Raphael▁Dubois,▁asked▁about▁this▁bioluminescent▁clam.
We▁ask▁these▁amnesiac▁patients to▁tell▁us▁which▁one▁they▁own,▁which▁one▁they▁chose▁last▁time,▁which▁one is▁theirs.
And I▁think▁some of▁these▁technologies will▁enable▁us to be▁more▁connected▁with▁our▁patients, to▁take▁more▁time and do the▁important▁human-touch▁elements of▁medicine,▁as▁augmented▁by▁these▁technologies.
And I▁explained to▁him▁quickly, I▁would▁train psycho-social▁counselors, I▁would open▁centers, and I▁explained to▁him▁why.
I love the▁design, for▁what▁it's▁worth, of▁this▁thing.
For▁far▁too▁many▁schools, for▁kids▁who live in▁poverty,▁their▁schools▁are▁really not▁schools▁at all.
It's▁this▁absolutely▁phenomenal▁disruption of the▁immune▁system that is the▁key to▁why▁people die of▁this▁virus.
▁Thank you.
So we▁plot▁data for▁sample on▁this.
▁Certain▁other▁strains– like HPV 6 and 11–▁cause▁abnormalities in the▁cells of the▁infected▁tissue,▁which can▁develop▁into genital▁warts.
These▁worms, on the▁other hand,▁have▁protein▁molecules▁sticking▁together▁inside▁them -- like▁humans▁with Alzheimer's.
Today, the▁practicalities of▁making▁such an▁encyclopedia,▁regardless of the▁magnitude of the▁information▁put▁into▁it,▁are▁within▁reach.
It▁maxes▁out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, and▁then▁it▁starts▁slowing▁down, and▁here's a▁cautionary▁note.
And we clean▁them▁up▁with▁technology.
▁Some of the▁teenagers▁said that in▁fact the▁car was 15 feet▁away▁when▁it▁shot.

▁They can▁sense the▁magnetic▁fields of the▁earth.
So▁it's cool.
▁This is▁going to▁change▁science, I▁believe, and▁it will▁change▁religion.
But▁then I▁stopped,▁because I▁figured I was▁this▁hot-shot▁guy and I▁shouldn't▁have to▁work▁at▁ideas,▁they▁should just▁come like▁magic.

CA: You've▁got a▁company▁set▁up to ...
God will▁forgive▁us.
He was▁passionate,▁where Madison was▁restrained.
Now, the▁model is▁intuitively▁right.

So, Chris was▁able to do▁his▁change -- he▁didn't▁have to log in▁or▁anything; he just▁went on the▁website and▁made a▁change.
So▁it's an▁interesting paradox▁at▁play▁there.
▁Why?▁Because that was the▁moment▁when the Indian▁television▁soap▁opera, "Kyunki Saas Bhi▁Kabhi▁Bahu▁Thi," dubbed▁into▁Dari, was▁telecast on Tolo T.V.
▁This fundamental▁bug of▁capitalism,▁more▁than▁any▁other▁single▁factor, is to▁blame for▁our▁climate▁predicament.
And all of you -- we --▁create▁this▁data.
It▁actually▁uses▁its▁tail▁too, just like we▁saw in the▁lab.
▁Let's▁start▁with the▁old▁Copernican▁question:▁Are▁there▁earths▁around▁other▁stars?
And▁they▁have to▁risk▁their▁lives▁almost▁every▁day to do▁this.
And▁once for an interdisciplinary▁class, I was▁screening the▁opening▁segment of Ingmar▁Bergman's "The▁Seventh▁Seal."

He▁censored my▁report.
The Koran▁declares that▁it▁comes to▁renew the▁message of the▁Torah and the▁Gospels.
The▁same▁way your▁thirst▁motivates you to get a▁drink of▁water, the▁same▁way your▁hunger▁motivates you to get a▁bite to▁eat, your▁anger can▁motivate you to▁respond to▁injustice.
▁What▁they▁did,▁though, is▁each in▁their▁own▁way,▁created a▁different▁way of▁navigating your▁way▁through▁technology.
Ever.
So he▁presses "sonicate," and▁this is▁what▁happens.
And▁it can do so▁much,▁because a▁tiny▁flicker of light that▁feeds on▁hope is▁enough to▁shatter the▁shield of▁darkness.
▁At▁first▁they're a little▁freaked▁out.
(Audience: It'd be an unfair▁advantage.) MS: It▁would be an unfair▁advantage▁if he▁gets to▁ride in a▁golf▁cart.
But▁what I'd like to▁talk to you▁about▁today is▁perhaps a▁way in▁which we▁could use▁technology to▁make▁those▁accidents▁happen▁often.
America.▁Germany. Japan. More▁power.

▁If you're▁interested in▁giving▁it a▁try, I'd▁encourage you to▁go to the Scratch▁website.
I'm▁ready and▁willing. I'm▁packing my▁gun.
▁How do we▁collect not just▁biological▁data▁but▁behavioral▁data,▁psychological▁data,▁relational▁data, in and on and▁around the▁home?
I'm a little▁bit▁lost, and▁it's▁finally▁time to▁make a real▁connection.
So,▁these▁young▁minds▁work▁over▁time to▁develop▁skills and▁virtues so that▁when the▁opportunity▁comes, no▁matter▁what that▁opportunity be, to stand▁up and do the▁right▁thing.
The▁other▁thing is you▁have to do▁things▁with a▁long▁time▁frame,▁as, you▁know, you can't▁expect to get▁something▁done in a▁year▁or▁two▁years; you▁have to be▁looking▁five▁or 10▁years▁ahead.
In the▁presence of God,▁there is no▁room for▁more▁than▁one "I," and that is the "I" of▁divinity.
And I▁happened to▁have a▁friend▁who was▁over, and he▁said, "Why▁don't you just▁wait."
▁How we use▁them is not just▁up to me,▁it's▁up to all of▁us.

So▁here's▁actually the▁patient▁survival▁data▁from▁eight▁different▁types of▁cancer.
▁Let's▁see▁if we, in the▁civilized▁world, can▁protest▁against▁what he▁did▁through▁insulting▁him in▁his▁search▁results."
▁This▁thing was designed▁three▁years▁after Gagarin▁first▁flew in▁space in 1961.
The▁answer▁both to▁why▁has a▁car▁seat▁been so▁successful, and▁why▁this▁may▁someday be▁adopted▁or not, lies in a▁story that my▁dad▁told me,▁relating to▁when he was a▁doctor in the U.S. Air Force in England. And▁this is a▁long▁time▁ago: you▁were▁allowed to do▁things▁then you can't do▁today.
DG:▁Well,▁go to Israel. You▁know,▁go to Israel. And a▁mall▁blows▁up, and▁then▁everybody's▁unhappy▁about▁it, and an▁hour-and-a-half▁later --▁at least▁when I was▁there, and I was 150 feet▁from the▁mall▁when▁it▁blew▁up -- I▁went▁back to my▁hotel and the▁wedding that was▁planned was still▁going on.
It's▁called "Learning To See"▁because▁it's▁about an▁object that▁hopefully▁works▁reflexively and▁talks▁about that▁vision▁or▁connection▁with the▁darkness of the▁body that I▁see▁as a▁space of▁potential.
▁That▁guy▁made a▁mistake.
▁Corruption is▁widespread and▁undermines the▁system and▁its▁moral▁legitimacy.
George Church▁thinks you can.
And▁it's▁fantastic.
(Laughter)▁They▁don't▁spend▁time▁alone.
And▁this is▁one of▁our▁creators.
Two▁years▁ago▁here▁at TED I▁reported that we▁had▁discovered▁at Saturn,▁with the Cassini▁Spacecraft, an▁anomalously warm and▁geologically▁active▁region▁at the▁southern▁tip of the▁small Saturnine▁moon Enceladus,▁seen▁here.
It's▁about▁our▁whole▁health and▁well-being.
Richard Searfoss: Good▁luck.
(Laughter) There▁are▁two▁interesting▁parts▁about▁this.
Now, I▁personally▁have no▁doubt▁whatsoever that the▁experience of▁beauty,▁with▁its emotional▁intensity and▁pleasure,▁belongs to▁our▁evolved▁human▁psychology.
▁Another▁study▁exposed▁cold▁air▁at▁regular▁intervals to the▁slime▁mold.
▁This is▁what's▁going on.
Now,▁another▁time we feel▁more▁confident▁speaking▁up is▁when we▁have▁expertise.
I▁wanted▁people to▁come▁up to me and▁tell me, "What▁did you do?"
But▁let me▁tell you a▁bit▁about▁it▁today.
With▁this▁approach,▁instead of▁painstakingly▁testing▁thousands of▁existing▁molecules▁one▁by▁one in a▁lab for▁their▁effectiveness, we can▁train a computer to▁explore the▁exponentially▁larger▁space of▁essentially all▁possible▁molecules that▁could be▁synthesized, and▁thus,▁instead of▁looking for a▁needle in a▁haystack, we can use the▁giant▁magnet of▁computing▁power to find▁many▁needles in multiple▁haystacks▁simultaneously.
I▁heard a▁story of▁some Marines▁who▁were▁out in▁theater, and▁as is the Marine▁custom, the▁officer▁ate▁last, and he▁let▁his▁men▁eat▁first, and▁when▁they▁were▁done,▁there was no▁food▁left for▁him.
▁This▁has▁never▁made▁much▁sense to me,▁this▁argument.

And I'm▁looking▁at the▁card on▁top and▁even▁though I▁could▁see▁clearly in my▁mind's▁eye▁what my▁business▁card▁looked like, I▁couldn't▁tell▁if▁this was my▁card▁or not,▁because all I▁could▁see▁were▁pixels.
So▁what▁did we do? We▁send▁it▁back to the▁editor.
But▁this is a▁very▁small▁part of▁what▁oxytocin is▁involved in.
He▁doesn't▁have the▁additional▁money, he▁doesn't▁have the▁resources.
▁Sometimes▁editors▁would▁tell▁their▁cartoonists to▁draw▁what▁they▁wanted to▁see, and the▁guy▁has to▁feed▁his▁family,▁right?
The▁first▁time I▁stood in the▁operating▁room and▁watched a real▁surgery, I▁had no▁idea▁what to▁expect.

▁Finally, the Sinaloa▁Federation.
The▁professionals▁never▁come▁near▁us,▁except in that▁case of Sylvia Browne that I▁told you▁about a▁moment▁ago.
It's▁actually a▁Scottish▁piece I've▁chosen.
And I▁have to▁tell you, I▁think▁it▁leads to▁some▁very▁strange▁excesses.
Now, the African▁continent, on the▁other hand,▁has▁vast▁amounts of▁arable land▁remaining and▁significant▁upside▁potential in▁yields.
It▁does not▁have to be that▁way.
▁Sometimes the▁monkeys get no▁bonus -- so▁this is a▁bonus of▁zero.
▁As a▁starting▁point, my brilliant▁students,▁Edmond Awad and Sohan Dsouza,▁built the Moral Machine▁website,▁which▁generates▁random▁scenarios▁at you --▁basically a▁bunch of▁random▁dilemmas in a▁sequence▁where you▁have to▁choose▁what the▁car▁should do in a▁given▁scenario.
But▁how▁much is that?
▁Maybe▁two▁brains of a▁similar▁size can▁actually be▁made of▁very▁different▁numbers of▁neurons.
I▁mean,▁from 1965 to 1973▁there▁were▁more▁munitions that▁fell on▁Cambodia▁than in all of World War II Japan,▁including the▁two▁nuclear▁bombs of August 1945.
It▁hurt me so▁bad that I▁wanted to▁quit▁right▁there.
A little▁rarer▁are the▁fallstreak▁holes. All▁right?
▁That's▁why▁VCs love to▁fund▁serial▁entrepreneurs --▁even▁if you▁didn't do▁it▁right the▁first▁time, you've▁learned the▁lessons,▁which▁puts you in▁good stead the▁next▁time.
You▁don't▁hear▁them▁now,▁because▁they▁borrowed▁from an▁era that was▁too▁steeped in▁its▁own▁connotation.

It's▁called "The▁Neighbor."
▁This is Brad▁doing▁one of the Ekman FACS▁poses.
So you▁have to▁make a▁living▁cartooning.
I feel that the best▁way I can▁help▁out▁anything is to▁help▁out▁very,▁very▁locally.

Can I feel the▁outside for a▁moment?
And the▁controversy is global▁warming.
▁This is▁something you▁leaked a▁few▁years▁ago.
It▁wasn't▁clear.
▁They▁figured▁out▁how▁it▁worked.
It's▁even▁worse in▁media.
So▁now we can▁continue▁this▁mutualism▁by▁suggesting that▁they can▁make an▁active▁tail.
▁Penguins▁are▁very▁vocal▁birds and▁really,▁really▁noisy, so I▁expected to▁walk▁into▁this▁building and be▁met▁with▁this▁cacophony of▁honking and▁braying and▁squawking.

▁If you▁want to get to the Phoenix Islands,▁it's▁five▁days▁from▁Fiji,▁it's▁five▁days▁from Hawaii,▁it's▁five▁days▁from▁Samoa.
I▁think that the World Trade Center in,▁rather an▁unfortunate▁way,▁brought▁architecture▁into▁focus in a▁way that I▁don't▁think▁people▁had▁thought of in a▁long▁time, and▁made▁it a▁subject for▁common▁conversation.
And you▁know, not▁everybody's▁going to like▁everything you do, and I've▁certainly▁developed a▁thick▁skin▁thanks to Internet▁comments,▁but that▁one's▁always▁bothered me,▁because we▁don't▁have▁too▁much▁time on▁our▁hands.
I▁thought, "Oh,▁good. Work is▁finished."
And▁it▁seemed to me that that was the▁wrong▁direction, and I▁needed to be▁back▁helping.
I▁think that▁video▁exposes so▁much of▁what's▁intrinsic to▁us▁as▁teachers in▁ways that▁help▁us▁learn and▁help▁us▁understand, and▁then▁help▁our▁broader▁communities▁understand▁what▁this▁complex▁work is▁really all▁about.
So you▁take▁this▁encrypted▁vote▁home▁as your▁receipt.
It's▁childhood▁trauma.
▁They▁cannot▁replace▁government.
We're▁going to▁jump▁onto the▁next▁one.
It▁doesn't▁face▁death.
▁If you've▁been in an MRI▁scanner,▁it's▁very▁much the▁same,▁but▁this▁one is▁outfitted in a▁special▁way to not just▁take▁pictures of your▁brain,▁but to also▁take▁pictures of▁active▁areas of the▁brain.
And▁some▁physicists▁think you can only un-baffle▁it▁if you▁imagine that▁huge▁numbers of parallel▁universes▁are▁being▁spawned▁every▁moment, and▁many of▁these▁universes▁would▁actually be▁very like the▁world we're in,▁would▁include multiple▁copies of you.
So, in 1998,▁along▁with my▁mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole, we▁went to▁actually▁start▁this▁work in Central Africa, to▁work▁with▁hunters in▁this▁part of the▁world.
▁Then▁she▁gets▁their▁bosses to rate▁how▁creative and innovative▁they▁are.

▁Basically▁people▁start to▁understand that▁they can▁change▁governments,▁but▁they▁cannot▁change▁policies.
▁Musicians▁are▁left▁with▁crumbs▁at the▁end of the▁whole▁food▁chain.
▁That's a▁hopeful▁message,▁but▁it's a▁message that's▁hopeful only▁if you▁understand▁it▁as incurring▁serious▁obligation for all of▁us.
▁When we▁blame▁personalities▁instead of the▁clarity, the▁accountability, the▁measurement, we▁add▁injustice to▁ineffectiveness.

A▁very simple▁tune▁based on▁three▁notes -- T, E, D.
So in▁order to▁help you▁understand▁where I'm▁coming▁from,▁let me bring you▁into my▁world, the▁world of▁experts.
▁This is not trivial,▁because▁listening is▁our▁access to▁understanding.
And▁having▁thought▁about▁this a little▁bit, I▁see a▁couple▁different▁possibilities.
▁Instead of▁writing that the▁grandmother▁died▁accidentally,▁from an▁overdose of opium,▁while▁having▁too▁much of a▁good▁time, I▁actually▁put▁down in the▁story that the▁woman▁killed▁herself, and that▁actually was the▁way▁it▁happened.

It was a▁remarkable▁tale,▁but Faiza▁saved the best for▁last.
I▁already▁knew▁how to▁design,▁but▁it▁wasn't like I was▁amazingly brilliant▁at▁it,▁but▁more like I was▁sensitive to the▁ideas of▁grids and▁space and▁alignment and▁typography.
And▁growing▁up, I▁found▁out that▁adults▁make a▁mess, and▁they're not▁very▁good▁at▁cleaning▁up▁after▁themselves.
So I was▁excited,▁then I▁panicked,▁then I was▁excited,▁then I▁panicked, and in▁between the▁excitement and the▁panicking, I▁started to do my▁research, and my▁research▁primarily▁consisted of▁Googling▁how to▁give a▁great TED Talk.
The▁lesson that I▁ultimately▁learned▁from my▁tattoo and that I▁want to▁leave you▁with▁today is▁this: We▁need to▁learn to love the▁flawed,▁imperfect▁things that we▁create and to▁forgive▁ourselves for▁creating▁them.
▁Of▁course,▁they▁covered that▁with▁make-up,▁because▁Lara▁Croft▁did all▁those▁same▁stunts --▁but▁she▁doesn't get▁black and▁blue,▁because▁she▁has▁sprezzatura.

And in the 1970s and '80s, a▁team of▁scientists▁mapped all 7,000▁connections▁between the▁neurons.
For▁instance, will we▁further▁reduce▁our▁nuclear▁arsenals▁globally,▁or will we▁spend▁billions,▁maybe a▁trillion▁dollars, to▁modernize▁them so▁they▁last▁throughout the 21st▁century, so that▁by the▁time Jasmine is my▁age,▁she's▁talking to her▁children and▁maybe▁even her▁grandchildren▁about the▁threat of▁nuclear▁holocaust?
JA:▁Yep. Yeah, and▁trusted▁people.
▁Instead, the▁opposite▁happened: It▁sort of▁created a▁magnification, like a▁magnifying▁glass, on the▁dictionary▁text.
▁What's▁important▁about▁bringing,▁now, the▁lived▁experience▁into▁this▁space to▁produce▁new▁knowledge is that we▁have to▁have a▁new▁way of▁delivering▁it.
But▁don't▁take my▁word for▁it --▁come▁with me.
▁About 20▁years▁ago, we▁were▁at a 15-percent▁loss.
On the▁left,▁it's▁when▁it's▁cold and the thermo-bimetal is▁flat so▁it will▁constrict▁air▁from▁passing▁through the▁blocks, and on the▁right, the thermo-bimetal▁curls and▁allows that▁air to pass▁through, so▁those▁are▁two▁different▁components that I'm▁working on, and▁again,▁it's a▁completely▁different▁thing,▁because you can▁imagine that▁air▁could▁potentially be▁coming▁through the▁walls▁instead of▁opening▁windows.
No ...

▁Sadly,▁patient noncompliance can be▁as high▁as 70▁percent.
The▁soil▁alone on Mars▁contains▁up to 60▁percent▁water.
And▁it was▁very▁important for▁us to▁establish the▁exact▁moment that▁it▁would▁fall,▁because▁if we▁made▁it in a▁way that▁it▁would▁topple▁over,▁then▁it▁would▁damage▁itself, and▁if▁it▁didn't▁fall▁enough,▁it▁wouldn't▁instill that▁fatalism,▁or that▁sense of▁wanting to▁go and▁help▁it.

So in▁fact▁what we▁have▁now is a▁system▁where we can use▁people on the▁ground,▁people▁who▁are▁already▁there,▁who can▁both▁improve and use the▁existing▁connectivity, and we're▁using▁old▁cell▁phones that▁are▁being▁sent to▁us▁by▁people▁from▁around the▁world that▁want▁their▁phones to be▁doing▁something▁else in▁their▁afterlife, so to▁speak.
The▁mirror▁allows that,▁but the▁mirror is not▁tainted, is not▁modified, is not▁altered▁by▁those▁images.

There's▁some▁kind of a▁blend that▁happens that▁allows, you▁know, to find▁innovation.
Is▁it a▁particle, like▁atoms,▁or is▁it a▁wave, like▁ripples on the▁surface of a▁pond?
One,▁two,▁three. Go!
We can▁go to▁watch▁our▁kid▁play▁soccer, and we▁have▁our▁cell▁phone on▁one hip and▁our Blackberry on▁our▁other hip, and▁our▁laptop,▁presumably, on▁our▁laps.
And I▁put on a▁slide▁where TED 1▁happened in my▁life.
▁Remoteness▁affects the▁quality of▁education.
There we▁are in Monterey --▁hopefully I can get▁it▁right.
▁Whenever that▁happens to me, I▁remember a▁powerful▁experience I▁had▁with my▁father.

▁Then▁there's all▁kinds of▁other▁applications. Implanted▁medical▁devices,▁where▁people▁don't▁have to die of▁infections▁anymore▁if you can▁seal the▁thing▁up.
But in▁other▁cases,▁this▁could be 18▁deletes and▁two▁keeps, and we▁would▁keep▁it,▁because▁if▁those▁last▁two▁keeps▁say, "Wait a▁minute.▁Nobody▁else▁saw▁this▁but I▁found▁it in a▁book, and I▁found a▁link to a▁page that▁describes▁it, and I'm▁going to clean▁it▁up▁tomorrow, so▁please▁don't▁delete▁it,"▁then▁it▁would▁survive.

▁Let's get to a▁specific▁part.
(Laughter)▁When I was▁at▁school, the▁books▁were▁transcribed▁by▁transcribers,▁voluntary▁people▁who punched▁one dot▁at a▁time so I'd▁have▁volumes to▁read, and that▁had▁been▁going on,▁mainly▁by▁women,▁since the▁late 19th▁century in▁this▁country,▁but▁it was the only▁way I▁could▁read.
And that▁story also▁resonated▁across the▁political▁spectrum.
I▁don't▁think we▁have to▁make that▁choice.

We▁connect▁events and▁emotions and▁instinctively▁transform▁them▁into a▁sequence that can be▁easily▁understood.
Now, I▁must▁tell you that▁this was▁never a▁very▁popular▁argument, and▁it's▁probably not▁very▁popular▁yet▁with▁some of you▁sitting in▁this▁audience.
And so▁as we▁developed▁more and▁more▁antibiotics,▁they,▁rightly so,▁became the▁first-line▁therapy for▁bacterial▁infections.
So▁this▁session is▁supposed to be▁about the▁future, so I'd▁thought I'd▁talk▁at least▁briefly▁about▁it.

So,▁happy▁continued▁success.
I▁want to▁tell you▁about my▁friend▁who was▁teaching English to▁adults in Abu Dhabi.

▁Spend▁some▁time▁with▁them.
▁This is▁actually▁one of the▁rangers.
▁This is▁unthinking▁engineering.
The▁claim to▁fame of Yahoo! was, we▁hire▁people to look --▁originally, not▁anymore -- we▁hire▁people to look▁at▁websites and▁tell you --▁if▁they're in the▁index,▁they're▁good.▁This, on the▁other hand, is▁what 60,000▁passionate▁volunteers▁produce in the Open Directory Project,▁each▁one▁willing to▁spend an▁hour▁or▁two on▁something▁they▁really▁care▁about, to▁say,▁this is▁good. So,▁this is the Open Directory Project,▁with 60,000▁volunteers,▁each▁one▁spending a little▁bit of▁time,▁as▁opposed to a▁few▁hundred▁fully▁paid▁employees. No▁one▁owns▁it, no▁one▁owns the▁output,▁it's▁free for▁anyone to use and▁it's the▁output of▁people▁acting▁out of▁social and▁psychological▁motivations to do▁something▁interesting.
There is▁work to do for▁everybody, and we▁need to▁have▁everybody on▁board.
▁Well, the▁argument I'd like to▁make is that▁networks▁have value.
Each of▁us▁has▁probably▁spent▁many,▁many,▁many▁hours▁typing on a computer▁without▁getting▁faster,▁but▁if we▁spent 10 to 20▁minutes▁each▁day▁fully▁concentrating on▁typing 10 to 20▁percent▁faster▁than▁our▁current▁reliable▁speed, we▁would get▁faster,▁especially▁if we also▁identified▁what▁mistakes we're▁making and▁practiced▁typing▁those▁words.

It's▁what▁makes a little▁girl▁play the▁clarinet▁at▁home,▁while her▁mother▁does the▁housework.
Not only do▁our▁children▁cope▁very▁well,▁but▁they▁excel in▁it.
A▁lot of▁data,▁but no▁theory.
And the▁problem is, that▁turns you▁into a▁shrewd▁animal▁who▁treats▁life▁as a▁game, and you▁become a▁cold,▁calculating▁creature▁who▁slips▁into a▁sort of▁mediocrity▁where you▁realize▁there's a▁difference▁between your▁desired▁self and your▁actual▁self.
Like all▁stories,▁it▁has a▁beginning.

(Laughter) I▁have▁yet to▁see▁somebody▁who is so▁turned on▁by▁somebody▁who▁needs▁them.
Now,▁many▁people▁hear▁these▁kinds of▁evolutionary▁claims and▁think▁they▁mean that we▁somehow▁are▁unconsciously▁seeking▁mates▁who▁are▁healthy.
I▁think▁if you do that, and you▁dig▁down▁through all of the▁misinformation, and the▁marketing on the▁part of the▁organic▁food▁industry and the Greenpeaces and find the▁science, the▁accurate▁science, you'll be▁surprised and▁pleased.

▁Briefly, to▁address▁this,▁our▁research▁program is▁focused▁around▁three▁meta-themes,▁or▁questions.
You can▁see▁beautiful▁bubblegum▁corals.
Immanuel Kant▁says the▁car▁should▁follow▁duty-bound▁principles, like "Thou shalt not▁kill."
Like,▁have you▁ever▁thought▁when you▁buy a▁car,▁how▁many▁people on▁how▁many▁different▁continents▁contributed to the▁manufacture of that▁car?▁Those▁are▁people in▁effect you're▁playing a non-zero-sum▁game▁with.
I▁know▁as a▁magician we're not▁supposed to▁reveal▁our▁secrets,▁but I'm not▁too▁afraid that▁people▁are▁going to▁start▁doing my▁show▁next▁week, so -- I▁think we're OK.
I▁have no▁interest▁at all in▁conceiving▁something in my▁brain and▁saying, "This is▁what▁it▁looks like." In▁fact,▁somebody▁mentioned --▁Ewan,▁maybe▁it was you in your▁introduction --▁about▁this is▁what▁architects --▁did▁somebody▁say▁it's▁what▁business▁people▁come to,▁it's▁what the▁corporate▁world▁comes to▁when▁they▁want to▁make▁it look like▁something▁at the▁end of the▁line?▁Huh.

▁Siblings can▁claim▁none of that▁uniqueness.
Back▁then, we▁had no▁idea▁how▁much▁this▁trip▁would▁change▁our▁lives.

▁Well, I was▁introduced▁as the▁former▁Governor of Michigan,▁but▁actually I'm a▁scientist.
And I find an un-dictionaried▁word -- a▁word like "un-dictionaried," for▁example -- in▁almost▁every▁book I▁read.▁What▁about▁newspapers?
And the▁trick▁here is to use a▁single,▁readable▁sentence that the▁audience can▁key▁into▁if▁they get a▁bit▁lost, and▁then▁provide▁visuals▁which▁appeal to▁our▁other▁senses and▁create a▁deeper▁sense of▁understanding of▁what's▁being▁described.
Now of▁course, you can only▁make a▁fossil in a▁sedimentary▁rock, a▁rock▁made▁by▁sand and▁mud.

We've▁lost▁our▁sense of▁outrage,▁our▁anger and▁our▁grief▁about▁what's▁going on in▁our▁culture▁right▁now,▁what's▁going on in▁our▁country, the▁atrocities that▁are▁being▁committed in▁our▁names▁around the▁world.
And▁perfumery▁shows you that can’t be▁true,▁because▁if▁it▁were like that▁it▁wouldn’t be an▁art, OK?

Back▁at the▁time, a▁window▁farm was no▁more▁than a▁technically▁complex▁idea that was▁going to▁require a▁lot of▁testing.
You do▁this▁effortlessly, so we▁don't▁see▁it,▁but that is▁how we get the▁world▁right, and▁it's a▁remarkable and▁very▁difficult-to-understand▁accomplishment.
I▁think▁it's▁worth the▁trouble▁because,▁again,▁it just▁helps▁us to▁understand.
"How▁many can we▁sell▁by the▁year 2000?"▁they▁asked.
We're not▁even in the▁top 10.
To▁start▁with, I'd like to▁break▁math▁down▁into▁two▁categories.
A▁lot of▁people▁wanted to▁make▁it▁their▁own,▁or▁asked me▁how▁it was▁made.

▁What▁about real▁people?
We▁have▁these▁technologies. We use▁them.

▁Let's look▁at the▁most▁successful▁technology▁executive in the▁business, and▁see▁how a▁presentation▁goes.
The▁idea is that,▁if we can▁watch▁how▁people's▁happiness▁goes▁up and▁down▁over the▁course of the▁day,▁minute to▁minute in▁some▁cases, and▁try to▁understand▁how▁what▁people▁are▁doing,▁who▁they're▁with,▁what▁they're▁thinking▁about, and all the▁other▁factors that▁describe▁our▁day,▁how▁those▁might▁relate to▁those▁changes in▁happiness, we▁might be▁able to▁discover▁some of the▁things that▁really▁have a▁big▁influence on▁happiness.
But▁then I▁realized that we▁humans▁are not▁actually▁interested in▁computing.

▁Some▁people▁would▁say that Islam▁means▁submission.
There▁are▁many▁ways in▁which I'm▁doing▁feminism▁wrong.
And▁then▁there's the▁second▁plate, the▁learning▁plate.
And I▁remember▁this▁plan,▁born▁out of▁frustration▁from a▁kid▁who▁kept▁calling me "Yogi,"▁then▁pointed▁at my▁tummy and▁said, "Too▁many▁picnic▁baskets."
So▁then I▁repeated▁this▁experiment a▁bunch of▁times, and▁one▁time▁something▁very▁interesting▁happened.
And a▁clear▁case of that, was▁something that▁happened in London in the▁year 2000.
▁Well,▁when you▁design an▁object that's▁supposed to▁interact▁with a▁human▁being,▁if you▁make a▁foam▁model of a mobile▁phone,▁it▁doesn't▁make▁any▁sense.
So the▁way we▁acquired the▁games is▁very▁interesting and▁very▁unorthodox. You▁see▁them▁here▁displayed▁alongside▁other▁examples of▁design,▁furniture and▁other▁parts,▁but▁there's no▁paraphernalia, no nostalagia, only the▁screen and a little▁shelf▁with the▁controllers.

Now▁if you▁think▁about the gut, the gut is --▁if you▁could▁stretch▁it -- 40▁meters▁long, the▁length of a▁tennis▁court.
▁This is,▁again, for a▁magazine,▁dividing▁pages.
▁If we▁really▁think that▁this is▁something that's▁happened in the▁last 30▁years,▁there's▁hope in that.

Now,▁this▁thing was▁probably▁about the▁size of a▁school▁bus▁when▁it▁first▁came in.
▁Are you an NGO?▁Are you the▁media?"
Over the▁last▁hundred▁years, we▁started▁building▁cars, and▁then▁over the 50▁years we've▁connected▁every▁city to▁every▁other▁city in an▁extraordinarily▁efficient▁way, and we▁have a▁very high▁standard of▁living▁as a▁consequence of that.

▁Where▁does▁this▁intelligence of▁knowing that a▁fold can▁actually hold▁more▁information, so▁as you▁actually▁watch the▁baby's▁brain▁grow.
And▁then we▁have▁our eureka▁moment.
It▁comes▁out of the▁idea of a▁window.
▁This is▁going to▁influence▁policy, I▁think, in▁years to▁come.
I'm still▁using that▁old▁technology▁with a▁bicycle▁cable on▁his▁right▁side.
(Laughter) Okay.
▁Some of▁them▁are just▁countries▁who▁believe that▁deregulation▁or no▁regulation is the best▁way to▁attract▁investment,▁promote▁trade.
▁That's▁why we look▁different.
Nigeria: 70▁percent of▁roads▁are untarred. Zambia: 80▁percent.
▁Imagine▁if you▁did not▁have your▁kids.
So▁here is the▁first▁test▁scenario.

We▁are▁told that▁divine▁knowledge▁comes▁down▁through the▁masculine,▁whether▁it be to the▁imam, the▁priest, the▁rabbi, the▁holy man.
And I'm▁thinking,▁it's▁because in that▁moment of▁them▁seeing an▁object▁they▁have no▁frame of▁reference for,▁or so▁transcends the▁frames of▁reference▁they▁have▁with the▁wheelchair,▁they▁have to▁think in a▁completely▁new▁way.
These▁panels▁have a▁similar▁shape to solar▁water▁heaters,▁except▁they do the▁opposite --▁they cool the▁water,▁passively,▁using▁our▁specialized▁material.
And that's▁fortunate,▁because we can▁put▁two▁electrodes on your▁palm and▁measure the▁change in▁skin▁resistance▁produced▁by▁sweating.
I▁think you▁couldn't be▁human▁if you▁didn't▁ask▁those▁questions.
And the▁result of▁this is that▁if you do a Google▁search on▁images▁right▁now and you▁type in "Illuminated▁manuscript Koran" for▁example, 24 of the 28▁images you'll find▁come▁from my▁institution.
▁How can we▁honestly and▁genuinely▁encourage▁more▁people to▁vote▁when▁votes▁don't▁count in Canada?

▁This▁site was▁bare and▁eroding for▁over 30▁years▁regardless of▁what▁rain we▁got.
There's a▁guy▁talking to a▁rabbi.
And I▁realized▁something▁interesting: Avaz▁helps▁children▁with▁autism▁learn▁words.
Last▁story▁here: I've▁got a▁friend in India▁who▁told me that you▁haven't▁really▁tested a▁piece of▁electronic▁technology for▁distribution in Asia,▁until you've▁trained a▁cockroach to▁climb in and▁pee on▁every▁single little▁component on the▁inside.
The▁importance is▁what you do▁with the▁images, the▁statement▁it▁makes▁where▁it's▁pasted.
And▁while we▁might▁trust▁our▁governments▁right▁now,▁right▁here in 2011,▁any▁rights we▁give▁away will be▁given▁away for▁good.
▁Waiting for▁others to▁change▁their▁behavior on your▁behalf, for your▁survival, is a▁terrible▁idea.
So you▁go and you▁type in your▁phone▁number, and▁at the▁exact▁minute▁where you▁want to be▁called -- (Laughter) And▁at that▁moment your▁phone will▁ring.
I've not▁time to▁go▁into▁more of▁it.
The▁animals▁are in▁one of▁their▁human▁lives. The▁humans▁are▁human.
And we can use that▁same▁idea to▁create▁rules for▁robots.
I▁see▁it▁everywhere.
(Laughter) Now, Steve, you▁know▁where the▁spike is,▁but▁nobody▁else,▁does?▁Correct?
We're the▁new▁technologists.
Okay. We▁had a▁team▁out▁watching▁this▁glacier, and we▁recorded the▁biggest▁calving▁event that's▁ever▁been▁put on▁film.
And we all▁know that▁when we▁make▁decisions in▁groups,▁they▁don't▁always▁go▁right.
▁Our▁access to digital▁money and▁our▁ability to▁freely▁transact is▁being▁held▁captive▁by▁these▁gatekeepers.
The "how" of▁cities,▁however, is a▁whole▁other▁story.
▁Mystery▁number▁one is▁this: Two million▁years▁ago, the▁human▁brain▁exploded in▁size.
TS: I'm just▁going to▁throw▁this▁into an▁orbit and▁see▁if I can▁paint▁everybody's▁shoes in the▁front.
So▁it's like the▁equator▁or the▁lines of▁longitude.
You▁shouldn't▁worry▁about▁it.
Water is▁actually▁flowing▁through▁there.
So all▁four of▁these▁ideas that I've▁presented you▁are▁ways in▁which we can▁expand Amira's▁choice▁set.
Now we all live in▁some▁kind of a▁social and▁cultural▁circle.

By▁getting▁into▁people's▁files like that, yeah,▁they▁broke the▁law,▁but▁they also▁forced that▁company to fix▁their▁product.
You▁take the▁patient and▁show▁him▁pictures on the▁screen and▁measure▁his▁galvanic▁skin▁response.
▁If you▁leave▁it on the▁pavement and▁if all the▁adults▁go▁away,▁then▁they will▁show▁off▁with▁each▁other▁about▁what▁they can do.

So▁when my▁students▁asked, "How do we▁stop▁this▁senseless▁violence?"
▁This was▁actually just▁taken▁last▁year.
And▁this was the▁first▁prototype in Korea,▁as we're▁dealing▁with a▁dynamic▁envelope, and▁then the▁same▁characteristic of the▁fabric.
▁That▁perhaps will▁allow▁us to▁identify the▁cause of a▁cancer that▁afflicts▁us▁or▁identify the▁source of an▁outbreak that we▁aren't▁familiar▁with▁or▁perhaps▁create a▁new▁tool in▁molecular▁biology.
So▁this is▁what we▁created for "Apollo 13."
▁Edicts like, "Defer▁judgment,"▁or "Go for▁quantity."
▁This is▁what▁causes the▁itchy,▁red▁bumps,▁by the▁way.
SS:▁Why▁don't you▁show▁them your▁legs?
One▁thousand▁prisoners▁who▁sat in▁meditation.
But▁many of▁these▁other▁factors that▁were in▁play▁are▁now▁even▁stronger▁than▁before.▁Half the▁work is▁already▁done.
In▁most▁low- and▁middle-income▁countries, for▁instance, the▁ratio of▁psychiatrists to the▁population is▁something like▁one for▁every▁one and a half million▁people,▁which▁literally▁means that 90▁percent of the▁people▁needing mental▁health▁services will not get▁it.
Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong,▁Singapore and Sidney.
A▁single▁female will▁lay▁about▁up to 100▁eggs▁at a▁time,▁up to▁about 500 in her▁lifetime.
In the 90s, only 1.2▁percent, only 1.2▁percent.
I▁take a▁picture of▁them▁everyday▁because I▁never▁know▁if I will▁make▁it▁back to▁them.

And▁from▁this▁stuff we▁came.
▁If I can▁leave you▁with▁one▁big▁idea▁today,▁it's that the▁whole of the▁data in▁which we▁consume is▁greater that the sum of the▁parts, and▁instead of▁thinking▁about▁information▁overload,▁what I'd like you to▁think▁about is▁how we can use▁information so that▁patterns▁pop and we can▁see▁trends that▁would▁otherwise be▁invisible.

I▁remember▁walking▁into a▁flophouse▁with an▁early▁version of the▁book and▁showing▁one of the▁guys▁his▁page.
▁Another▁thing that▁helped me▁as a little▁kid is,▁boy, in the '50s, you▁were▁taught▁manners.
▁They▁need to▁put▁resources▁elsewhere. But we can still do▁it.

I▁finally▁got▁around to▁calculus▁as a 32-year-old▁tenured▁professor▁at Harvard,▁where I▁sat▁uncomfortably in▁classes▁with▁undergraduate▁students, little▁more▁than half my▁age.
And all of▁these▁studies▁found the▁same▁conclusion.
I▁visited an▁organization, and▁they▁adopted▁this▁idea that▁if you can▁see▁it, you can be▁it.

And▁sometimes just▁taking an▁interest in the▁individual, in the▁fellows you've▁met, and the▁businesspeople you've▁met,▁it can▁make a▁huge▁difference,▁especially in Africa,▁because▁usually the▁individual in Africa▁carries a▁lot of▁people▁behind▁them.
We▁first▁figure▁out▁where the▁ball is▁going.
The▁data that we're▁receiving is▁really▁exciting and▁telling▁us --▁forcing▁us to▁think▁about▁this in▁new and▁exciting▁ways.
Again,▁see▁number▁one.
And▁then we▁give▁it a▁second▁gene to▁grow an▁inorganic▁material that can be▁used to▁split▁water▁into▁oxygen and▁hydrogen, that can be▁used for clean▁fuels.
▁That▁same▁anger▁could be▁transformed▁into▁it.
▁Since I'm a▁photographer, I like the▁way▁it's▁lit and▁looks.

I▁wish I was that▁coordinated.
So, for me,▁what was▁important is that▁this▁coffee▁set --▁which is just a▁coffee▁pot, a▁teapot, and▁those▁are the▁pots▁sitting on a▁tray -- that▁they▁would▁have a▁coherence -- so,▁they▁would be Greg Lynn Alessi▁coffee▁pots --▁but that▁everyone▁who▁bought▁one▁would▁have a▁one-of-a-kind▁object that was▁unique in▁some▁way.
We▁want to▁neutralize the▁tensions.
But my▁insides▁were▁rotting▁away.
▁Because▁facing your▁own▁mortality▁causes a re-evaluation of▁priorities, and a realignment of▁what your▁goals▁are in▁life,▁unlike▁anything▁else.
Second, we▁have to▁stop▁cautioning▁our▁girls willy-nilly.
For the▁next 14▁minutes▁or▁whatever▁it is, will you feel▁stuff?

And in▁order to▁hear me and▁understand▁what I'm▁saying, you▁need to▁process▁about 60▁bits per▁second.
Now▁many of▁these▁companies▁were in America▁or the United▁Kingdom,▁its▁overseas▁territories and▁Crown▁dependencies, and so▁it's not just an▁offshore▁problem,▁it's an on-shore▁one▁too.
Having a▁lab that can▁travel to▁collections▁where▁it's▁needed,▁however, is only▁part of the▁solution.

▁What▁has▁happened▁since, and▁what do the▁experts▁predict will▁happen▁with the▁number of▁children▁during▁this▁century?
He's an▁organic▁farmer.
▁That is▁what▁bioenergy is. It is not▁ethanol. It is not▁subsidies to a▁few▁companies. It is not▁importing▁corn▁into Iowa▁because you've▁built so▁many of▁these▁ethanol▁plants. It is▁beginning to▁understand the▁transition that▁occurred in▁agriculture,▁from▁brute▁force▁into▁biological▁force. And in the▁measure that you can do that, you can clean▁some▁stuff, and you can clean▁it▁pretty▁quickly.

▁That was an▁interesting▁case.
▁Nothing▁has▁happened.
And▁as a computer▁scientist,▁what▁this▁means is that I've▁been▁able to▁build▁models that can▁predict all▁sorts of▁hidden▁attributes for all of you that you▁don't▁even▁know you're▁sharing▁information▁about.
▁Since▁then, in the▁intervening 40▁years, I've▁spent▁about 3,000▁hours▁underwater, and 500▁hours of that was in▁submersibles.
The Indian▁cleverness was▁using▁its▁traditional▁knowledge,▁however,▁scientifically▁validating▁it and▁making that▁journey▁from▁men to▁mice to▁men, not▁molecule to▁mice to▁men, you▁know.
In the▁early '70s▁when I▁started, I▁got▁right▁down in the▁chutes to▁see▁what▁cattle▁were▁seeing.
Light is▁converted to▁electricity on▁them.
A▁cheery▁thought.
