        "This is a Colab notebook for calculating automatic metrics for machine translation (MT) quality evaluation, which covers the *Data Evaluation* dimension of the [DataLit<sup>MT</sup> Competence Matrix](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/matrix/) and here particularly the subdimensions of *Data Analysis*, *Data Verbalisation* (to some extent) and *Data Interpretation*. Given that MT systems are increasingly used as productivity-enhancing tools in the professional translation process, both manual and automatic evaluation of MT output become more and more important. Automatic MT quality evaluation is part of *Technical MT Literacy*, as illustrated in the [Professional Machine Translation Literacy Framework](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/framework/#professional-mt-literacy). In this notebook, we will introduce two traditional MT quality metrics based on string matching and two modern embedding-based metrics, and we will illustrate the differences between these metrics. After working through this notebook, you should have a basic understanding of how automatic MT quality evaluation works and how the various scores differ from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code used for the score calculations in this notebook is adopted from the Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)) and the respective GitHub repositories of each metric (references will be given throughout the notebook).\n",
        "\n",
        "All metrics presented in this notebook are based on a comparison between a machine-translated sentence (which is often called *hypothesis* in MT research) and a corresponding human reference translation (*reference*), which is the 'gold standard' that any MT hypothesis should strive to achieve. The fundamental distinction we make in this notebook is between traditional MT quality scores which rely on exact string matching between string A (MT output/hypothesis) and string B (reference translation/gold standard) to calculate the similarity or dissimilarity between the two strings, and embedding-based metrics, which use the concept of *word embeddings* to calculate the (dis)similarity between hypothesis and reference based on the relative proximity of their word embeddings in high-dimensional vector space. If you’re confused right now, don’t worry, we will explain all of this in more detail in the course of this notebook."

In order to avoid overcrowding the current notebook, we created [a companion notebook for automatic MT quality evaluation metrics based on string matching](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G0uwf5kPG5d5kmd-LbvkkssKoza9N622?usp=sharing), which covers these three concepts in detail.

(2002): BLEU: A Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1040.pdf). BLEU is still a commonly used automatic MT quality score because it is widely known in MT research and practice and it often achieves reasonably good correlations with human quality judgements.

The closer the machine translation is to the reference translation, the better is the quality of the MT output (remember that we consider the reference to be our gold standard). Therefore, the *higher* the BLEU score calculated for a given MT output/reference pair, the *higher* the quality of the MT output is assumed to be, and vice versa.\n",

If you want to skip this notebook, just bear in mind that word embeddings offer a way to compare the *semantic* similarity between two words, instead of just their *formal* similarity (as string-based metrics such as BLEU and TER do). For example, string-based metrics would consider the two words *car* and *automobile* to be dissimilar because they differ in their surface forms. Embedding-based metrics, on the other hand, would consider the two words to be similar because they basically express the same meaning.

BERTScore rescales this output so that it lies in a range between 0 and 1, with 0 being a very poor and 1 being a very good score (all differences aside, BERTScore is basically a similarity measure, just like BLEU). As you can see, our hypothesis-reference pair is scored very highly (BERTScore-F-Measure = 0.8595) because the two sentences express almost the same meaning, although they differ in their respective surface forms. Remember that our string matching-based metric BLEU scored the same hypothesis-reference pair rather poorly. This illustrates again the fundamental difference between traditional metrics based on string matching and modern embedding-based metrics: String-based metrics can only capture formal similarities between two strings whereas embedding-based metrics can capture semantic similarities between two strings, regardless of any formal differences between them. Keep this important difference in mind for future MT quality evaluation scenarios."

        "\n",
        "COMET is an embedding-based metric relying on semantic similarity and trained additionally on human quality judgements. **COMET** is an acronym for **C**rosslingual **O**ptimized **M**etric for **E**valuation of **T**ranslation. It was originally proposed  in [Rei et al. (2020): COMET: A Neural Framework for MT Evaluation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.213/). In contrast to traditional MT quality metrics based on string matching (such as BLEU or TER) and in contrast to the embedding-based metric BERTScore, COMET uses not only the machine-translated hypothesis and the human-translated reference but also the original source sentence. COMET is then able to measure the interlingual semantic similarity between these three sentences, i.e., COMET can establish both the semantic similarity between hypothesis and reference as well as the semantic similarity between source and hypothesis/reference. In addition, COMET takes into consideration prior human quality judgements taken, for example, from a human error annotation of machine-translated sentences or from a human ranking of such sentences on a 100-point-ranking scale. These human quality judgements allow COMET to measure nuanced aspects of machine-translated sentences beyond semantic similarity to their source/reference sentences.\n"

Above the COMETinho value, you can see a segment score, which indicates the COMETinho score per sentence (= per segment). Since we only compute a score for one hypothesis in this example, the sentence score is identical to the overall COMETinho score. If you calculate a score for multiple sentences (as we do below), you would have multiple segment scores, and one overall COMETinho score. COMET(inho) scores are more difficult to interpret than the previous scores we covered in this notebook, since individual scores will have to be interpreted within the overall range of scores that were obtained using the respective COMET(inho) model in larger MT quality evaluation campaigns. So, scores such as 0.68 do not tell us anything by themselves but have to be interpreted relative to a COMET model’s score range. More information on this can be found in the [official COMET Documentation](https://unbabel.github.io/COMET/html/faqs.html#is-there-a-theoretical-range-of-values-for-the-comet-regressor) (the documentation does not provide any specific information on the COMETinho model we used in our example, so we don’t quite know whether 0.68 is a good or a bad score).
