The DataLit<sup>MT</sup> project at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Köln, Germany, developed didactic resources for teaching data literacy to BA students of translation and specialised communication programmes. The aim is for students working with these resources to develop an adequate MT literacy for their later professional career while at the same time becoming data-savvy citizens well equipped for the modern knowledge economy.

All theoretical and practical project outcomes are made available on our [DataLit<sup>MT</sup> Project website](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/). The Professional MT Literacy Framework and the DataLit<sup>MT</sup> Framework can be found [here](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/framework/). The DataLit<sup>MT</sup> Competence Matrix can be found [here](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/matrix/). Our academic outcomes can be found [here](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/outcomes/). And finally, all our didactic learning resources can be found [here](https://itmk.github.io/The-DataLitMT-Project/resources/). These learning resources are primarily created in the form of papers, Jupyter Notebooks and tutorial videos. The links to these notebooks and videos can be found on our website, whereas a static version of the notebooks and additional data (needed for certain resources) can be accessed in this GitHub repository. In our notebooks, we also refer to pre-written code saved in our respective GitHub folders.

This project is led by Professor Ralph Krüger. Also working on this project are Research Associate Janiça Hackenbuchner, Research Assistant Andre Busch and Lecturer Jürgen Esch.
