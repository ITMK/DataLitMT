The DataLit<sup>MT</sup> project based at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication ([ITMK](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/information-science-and-communication-studies/institute-of-translation-and-multilingual-communication__49825.php)) at [TH Köln](https://www.th-koeln.de/en/), Germany, provides didactic resources for teaching data literacy in its machine-translation specific form of professional MT literacy to students of translation studies/specialised communication programmes at BA and MA levels. The aim is for students working with these resources to develop adequate data and MT literacy for their later professional careers while at the same time becoming data-savvy citizens well equipped for the modern knowledge economy.

Together with the Directorate-General for Translation of the European Commission, we are organising a Translating Europe Workshop, in which we present the outcomes of the DataLit<sup>MT</sup> project. This Workshop will be held online on 19 April 2023. Join us and meet the team. Registration for this workshop will open soon.
